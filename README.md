My blog and portfolio all in one.

View my website at [`fvcproductions.com`](https://fvcproductions.com).

This website is a migration from my old Wordpress website at [`fvcproductions.wordpress.com`](https://fvcproductions.wordpress.com).

It was built from the bottom up!

## Installation

You need to have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed before running the following commands.

```bash
# install necessary dependencies

npm install

# start server

npm start
```

The site will be be displayed at `localhost:3000` with BrowserSync automatically reloading the page with any new changes.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com) and deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

```bash
# build static version in `/dist` folder

npm run build

# preview draft posts

npm run build-preview

# deploy dist folder to master (for GitHub pages)

npm run deploy
```
