For example, if a boy who really loves his grandma is looking at this magical old man, he will instead see someone who strongly resembles his grandma but is clearly not her.

The old man is a wizard who has been outcast from the rest of the magical world and has only enough dignity left to conjure this spell in order to get money/food.

## Tortured at Sea

- So there are prisoners tied down with a neck brace to the ground near the beach.
- There's an open space between the beach area where the prisoners are being held down and the sea.
- In this open space, there are the family members of the prisoners.
- Eva is one of the prisoners, the mother of Elijah, who has no one now since Eva's husband died in the war.
- All the prisoners are given a disposable plastic helmet that cannot be taken off while the host is alive and the helmet forces them to kill themselves by drowning by controlling their brain, basically.
- The bodies react to the helmet differently and so once the prisoners have their helmets on, they start to tumble, walk, run, skip, etc. towards the sea to drown themselves, all in their own style.
- Eva, having mentally prepared herself, walks slowly towards the sea to drown.
- She wants to see Elijah again.
- Elijah sees Eva coming closer.
- Unfortunately, since so many people were packed into the open space, Elijah had to position himself closer to the sea.
- Eva tells Elijah she loves him in a monotone voice because the helmet managed to control her voice.
- He gets her hand and wants to pull her away but he just gets pulled along and as she gets ready to drown herself, she squeezes his hand tightly and says “Always and so much”
- Eva finally let's go and tumbles towards her death at sea
- Elijah seeing that his mother is permanently gone, screams in agony “Noo” multiple times, screaming and crying at the sky
