Profile

Well, academically speaking, for someone who takes a look at my LinkedIn profile might rightly assume I'm a deeply technical person which is true because I graduated at the top of CS department at Hampton University in just 2.5 years. Before that, I decided to study abroad in Germany for a semester to just have a mix of scenery. None of my credits were able to transfer but I've been taking college level courses since the summer of my freshman year in high school which was 7 years ago in 2010.

Now, I'm set to complete my Masters in Computer Science at the age of 21 from Cornell Tech which is positioning itself as a revolutionary model for graduate education that fuses technology with business and creative thinking.

People describe me as level headed, reserved, and fiercely loyal and caring. Naturally, like with most people, if you get to know me well enough, you'll discover the first two are not necessarily true all the time as I can get quite emotional and talkative around people I genuinely feel comfortable around.

Personality wise, I consider myself someone who is fiercely loyal.

I mean this in the most literal way possible.

For all my food needs I go to 4 places. Liquitrria and Starbucks for drinks and the Maru Sushi and Jist Salad for food. My order is always remembered and I save tons of money through the loyalty programs.

I think one of the reasons I enjoy this sameness across my personal relationships and food is because I enjoy the fact that everything else is changing around me in my field. Its what drew to me to this field. The idea of constant iteration and development. Eventually I see myself settling for a more managerial position, but until then I'm content with creating.

I have a website with over 72k hits and its mostly just blog posts and what I've been grateful to experience since the summer of 2013. That's also when I started using GitHub.

Participated in Product School - one of youngest students admitted at age 20. Took on leadership roles through Operation Smile.

Hobbies: mentor, freelancer, and speaker.

As an ambassador for Fullstack Academy, I'm responsible for getting qualified students as ready as possible to enter the program. This week actually someone I prepared will be interviewing.

Assuming she gets in, I'll then get paid to mentor her at a very high price. They would usually just give me a referral bonus and also pay me hourly for events. However they're trying to become one of the few coding boot camps to get accredited by the dept. of education.

I've spoken at conferences and panels, the last being for a current student panel for prospective students at Cornell tech.

I attend hackathons . The most recent was acting as a judge for Hack Youngstown State University in Ohio.

I also freelance with my last gig being a blogger for AlterConf which I got paid 200 bucks for.

Hiya, there! I'm Frances.

I consider myself a developer with a design background and I tend to get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in NYC and hope to kick butt in the tech scene as a product guru after graduating in order to utilize both my design and dev skills.

As I mentioned before, I have a varied skill set. What does this actually imply? Well, I happen to enjoy freelance blogging and freelance web design & development, mentoring folks 1-to-1, and speaking at tech conferences or related events. These are all side hobbies though as my true passion lies in creating charming and constructive products.

I'm a 21 year old Latina developer with a panache for design. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in downtown Chelsea at the Google campus. I personally get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set.

What does "varied skill set" actually imply? Well, I happen to enjoy freelance blogging and freelance web design & development, mentoring folks 1-to-1, and speaking at tech conferences or related events. These are all side hobbies though as my true passion lies in creating charming and constructive products.

In terms of academic backgrounds, I received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hampton University May 2016 and have attended various external programs before like Fullstack Academy (web development), Designlab (web design), and Product School (product management).

My past work experience includes first working part-time as a front-end developer while in my last semester at Hampton University at a local consulting agency called 80|20 in Norfolk, VA. Later, I interned as a wearables developer for Accenture Liquid Studio in Redwood City, CA during summer 2016. For spring 2017, I will be interning at NBCUniversal at 30 Rockefeller as a media tech intern.

I am one of the few Latinas I know studying computer science (the only one in my program at Cornell Tech right now even if I'm not mistaken) and because I realized my isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to want to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.
