I don’t know if you remember me but we Skyped a while ago. You were nice enough to let me ask you questions and get [advice on the application process](http://fvcproductions.com/2016/03/31/all-the-bootcamp-things/) for [Fullstack](http://fullstackacademy.com). I went into the admissions process with way more confidence and I got in!

So thank you, you were extremely helpful.

**Update**

It's Angel! First day of Senior Phase at Fullstack. It's been crazy as hell, but I've learned so much in the past six weeks. Thanks again for all the help!
