## LinkedIn 💼️

If you'd like to stay in touch professionally, don't hesitate to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions).

## Book a Chat 📅

You can schedule a time to chat with me using [my Calendly](https://bit.ly/chat-with-frances).

My time is very valuable to me so I charge $10 for every 30 minutes to ensure we both get the most value out of the session and to avoid no shows.

## Invite Me to Speak 💬

For speaking engagements, I require an honorarium. For events outside San Francisco, I also require reimbursement for flights, ground transportation, hotel accomodations and meals. I am flexible to negotiation on the honorarium for community-driven or non-profit events.

You can find my bio and headshot photo on [my about page](/about/).

You can find all the events I've spoken at [my speaking page](/speaking/) and a sampling of the different types of talks I've given [on my talks page](/talks/).

If you are interested in inviting me to speak, please use the contact form and feel free to touch on the points below.

- What are the topics to be covered in the talk?
- What does the audience makeup look like?
- What is the expected number of attendees for my talk or the event overall?
- What is the budget for honorariums?
- What is the budget for travel/hotel?

## Contact Form

I'll do my best to get back to you within 2 weeks. Upon submission of this form, I will be sent an email.
