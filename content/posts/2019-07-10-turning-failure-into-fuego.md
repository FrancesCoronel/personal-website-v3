## Overview

As people of color working in tech, we are surrounded by stories of success, but rarely do we feel comfortable enough sharing our own missteps.

At Turning #FailureIntoFuego, we’ll welcome a panel of successful Latinx professionals in the tech industry to talk about how they've embraced moments of failure in their careers and turned them into opportunities for growth.

Join us for an inspiring evening with intimate conversation, food and drink, dance lessons and more at Slack HQ in San Francisco, in partnership with Earthtones (Slack's employee resource group for people of color) and The Latinx Collective.

P.S. For the San Francisco readers: I will be co-hosting an event with Slack Earthtones in San Francisco on July 10th and the topic is how to turn Failure Into Fuego. 🔥🔥

As people of color, we are surrounded by stories of success in the tech industry but not from our own community. Rarely do we feel comfortable enough sharing our mistakes - after all we often have so much more to lose.

It’s going to be such a special event - you’ll hear from a panel of successful Latinx professionals on how they’ve embraced moments of failure in their careers and turned them into opportunities for growth, learn dance lessons (the literal way to learn from missteps), get free headshots and even walk away with some inspiring candles to light that fuego at home.🔥

If you’re in SF that day, RSVP here asap to grab a seat + feel free to forward it to friends & colleagues.

Many thanks to the wonderful Frances Coronel (a long-time subscriber!) who is organizing on the Slack side. 🙌

I’m looking forward to meeting you there.
