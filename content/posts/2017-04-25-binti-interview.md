description: Notes from my interview with Binti
---

- foster care agencies are suffering from much worse IT than found in private
  sector
- Binti is selling agency tools that is supposed to increase their productivity
- Binti is allowing foster care agencies to approve more foster applications
  faster which is addressing the shortage of foster homes
- Binti aims to be compliant with federal standards
- Binti aims in getting more homes online to address the shortage
- Binti also aims to elevate low moral among caseworkers
- Binti's sales people showcase Binti as a way to reduce time spent on casework
  which will allow the agency to reallocate staff and regain subsidies
- Binti uses a variety of techniques for reaching the right people like
  leveraging SF to start a campaign in CA since SF staff know a lot of agencies
  - use geography -- cold outbound over phone -- administrator -- we're already
    working with your neighbor two counties away
  - talk about --> delighting earlier customers is key
  - early customers are sharing good things about the product
- users: social workers + approval workers (all they do is approve families) +
  clerical/probation teams --> permissions
- foster families are able to apply online --> collaborate
- privacy leaks -> field has sort of settled on HIPPA as a framework of securing
  systems
- 9 people --> HIPPA compliance --> not trying to pave new ground by trying to
  utilize work of other companies --> leaning heavily on Google --> secure cloud
  --> HIPPA apps --> Google proprietary software --> HIPPA minded software &
  founders --> full time devops & security person
- LA was our first agency that has sub agencies --> aggressive timeline --> 100
  different systems --> legacy system
- SF had used Excel --> master spreadsheet --> they try 1 or 2 vendors every
  year
- CaseCommons --> nonprofit custom software development for states and counties
  and cities
- 712K in revenue for 2017, big discounts for early customers --> need to charge
  more --> 50% of subsidies came from gov.
- asked for a daily refresh in Binti from state databases
- training libraries --> video documentation --> say hi to check in on them
- customer support --> ETO, Social Solutions, Mora --> company that Tera used to
  work for --> Social Solutions --> gen. purpose software used to overview
  workers
- field populated at the policy & social science level that we only need to end
  up bringing the tech
