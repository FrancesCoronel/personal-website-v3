### Inspiration

Jake the Dog has a key hand.

### What it does

Web app that uses LeapMotion to authenticate user trying to enter their
home.

### How we built it

Using CodeKit, we hosted a website and plugged in a lot of Leap Motion
plugins along with the API.

### Challenges we ran into

Getting the Leap Motion hands to display properly was hard. We spent a
lot of time working on features that we shouldn’t have.

### Accomplishments that we’re proud of {#accomplishments-that-we-re-proud-of}

Getting it to work in only a few hours!

### What we learned

Different Leap Motion plugins.

### What’s next for Jake the Dog Key Hand | Security Corp {#what-s-next-for-jake-the-dog-key-hand---security-corp}

Optimizing the UI, extending password combination capabilities (multiple
numbers).

### Installation

- Use `CodeKit` to minify `CSS` and `JS` files
- Make sure to have LeapMotion installed on your computer
