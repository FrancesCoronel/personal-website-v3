Frances prepared an excellent [presentation](http://fvcproductions.com/2015/12/07/hour-of-code-2015/) when she volunteered in my classes on December 7th, 2015 during the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) Activity. She was professional and her presentation was instructional and entertaining. She provided students with valuable information about the Computer Science field of study and job market. She also provided assistance to students who needed help with the Hour of Code activities.

I am very grateful to have had Frances as a presenter and her assistance during the Hour of Code in my classes.
