## About

I blogged about this conference more extensively <a href="https://fvcproductions.com/2015/01/30/adventures-with-aaai-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="AAAI 2015">here</a>.

The Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15) was held January 25–30, 2015 at the Hyatt Regency in Austin, Texas, USA.

The purpose of the conference is to promote research in artificial intelligence (AI) and scientific exchange among AI researchers, practitioners, scientists, and engineers in affiliated disciplines.

I was accepted to the conference as a Student Scholar.

The Student Scholar Program provides partial travel support for students who are full-time undergraduate or graduate students at colleges and universities; are members of AAAI; submit papers to the conference program or letters of recommendation from their faculty advisor; and submit scholarship applications to AAAI.
