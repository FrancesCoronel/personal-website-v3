So here are 3 of my favorite power tools that changed how I worked and
my average level of productivity on a daily basis.

There are other awesome power apps of course, like

- [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12 "Amphetamine")
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com "Bartender")
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash "Dash")
- [Flux](https://justgetflux.com "Flux")
- [Sorty](https://wiles.dk/ "Sorty")
- [Ubersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/ "Ubersicht")
- [Yoink](https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/Yoink_-_Draggings_a_drag_no_more/Yoink_-_Draggings_a_drag_no_more%21.html "“Yoink”")

among others - but these 3 are by far my favorite.

1. [Automator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_%28software%29 "“Automator”")
===================================================================================

![Automator](https://www.redundantrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/automator.png)

Seriously, I’ve done things with this guy in seconds that would take
others hours. Automator is a lot like Terminal in terms of power, but
with a graphical interface.

Here are 3 examples of Automator workflows that have helped me out
significantly.

1. Import Multiple Fonts
------------------------

You know when you go crazy and you decide you want to get all these
fonts for a creative project you’re working on and so now you have about
100 different fonts in your `Downloads` folder?

And then you even start to click on them one by one to import them to
your Font Book…

**Say no more! Automator to the rescue!**

2. PDF To Images
----------------

You know when you have a PDF file and need all the pages to be images so
you can upload them to some website that only accepts images - like
Behance?

So now you have this 20 page PDF file and you start to export each page
to a `png` file one by one…

**Say no more! Automator to the rescue!**

3. Rename Multiple Photos
-------------------------

Okay, this one’s pretty obvious.

You know when you have a ton of cool wallpapers you just downloaded and
they’re all named something crappy like `1250x1280` or something?

So now you have 30+ wallpaper images in your `Downloads` folder and
because you’re OCD, you start to rename each image one by one to an
appropriate title like `Wallpaper - 1`…

**Say no more! Automator to the rescue!**

2. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/ "“Alfred”")
=================================================

![Alfred](https://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/22/16/13/221613ff-de88-908e-684d-262576f7dbd0/icon128-2x.png)

> Oh, Alfred, where would I be without you?
>
> You’re prettier than [LaunchBar](https://www.alfredapp.com/ "“Alfred”")
> and 10 times more powerful than
> [Spotlight](https://www.alfredapp.com/ "“Alfred”").
>
> If you were a person, I know you’d be my gay best friend.

Definitely not a haiku there, but man - just goes to show how much I
depend on the damn bowler hat.

3. [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12 "“BetterSnapTool”")
========================================================================================================

![BetterSnapTool](https://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/b0/e1/f1/b0e1f178-69dc-f01a-3d4e-0faa4379ca8f/icon128-2x.png)

I was so slow moving windows around before this app, so once I
transitioned to fast resizing, my whole workflow sped up significantly.
People wonder how I get things done so fast… BetterSnapTool is part of
the reason.

Only good things can be said about this app, seriously.
