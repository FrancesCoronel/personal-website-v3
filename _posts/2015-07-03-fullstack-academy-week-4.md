------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day One - Monday {#dayone-monday}
----------------

-   Much progress was made with Promises - I still need to review some
    more though.
-   We also started creating our own Bootstrap template with `SASS`.
    This has been really difficult, and I feel like I’ve only just now
    been introduced to the more technical CSS side of design. **Amateur
    time!!!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Two - Tuesday {#daytwo-tuesday}
-----------------

-   Worked more on this SASS framework - it’s tedious, but as a fellow
    student wisely stated, “it makes you appreciate
    [`Bootstrap`](http://getbootstrap.com/) a lot more”.
-   Afterwards, we had to make the framework responsive, and I feel as
    though this part was almost too easy. We’ll see what happens
    tomorrow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Three - Wednesday {#daythree-wednesday}
---------------------

-   A lot happened today!
-   We started creating this lovely trip planning application that
    utilizes the Google Maps API and a full on database with various
    different models. My pair programming partner and I made a lot of
    progress with the UI, which was the goal for the day.
-   There was a yoga session as well which did make me feel prettyyy
    relaxed, but also allowed me to slowly come to the realization of
    how terribly non-flexible my body is. Oh well!
-   And then after allwas said and done, there was a dinner that 13 of
    us went to - good times!
    -   It was at a steak house so I had limited options, but I learned
        a lot about finances in general.
        -   *Apparently*, there’s an app called
            [Venmo](https://venmo.com/ "Venmo") that is all the rage.
            It’s the first time in a while that I actually feel behind
            in the technological aspect. **ba da ba ba ba, I’m lovin
            it!** Hehe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Four - Thursday {#dayfour-thursday}
-------------------

-   Today was basically all about using `jQuery` to implement the live
    UI of our little trip planner app - and I **LOVE** `jQuery`. I found
    it funny how in the lecture Omri talked about how due to the fact
    that `jQuery` is so ubiquitous, some folks will say they know
    `jQuery` but not `JS` itself, even though `jQuery` **IS** a `JS`
    library!
    -   It reminded me of this video.
        \[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdREEcfaihg\]
-   For my *Bubblunch* (since my learning team’s name is Bubbles), we
    played 2 games of Avalon. In one of the games, I revealed I was
    Merlin by uttering *“Yeah”* in that part of the game where special
    people get to open their eyes and crap so we had to completely start
    over.
    -   If my mind resembled the plot line of the movie
        [`Inside Out`](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inside_out_2015/ "Inside Out"),
        then that moment of complete *FAIL* would become a hilarious
        core memory. ![Inside
        Out](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/32cea-inside2bout2bpixar2bpost2b2.png){.aligncenter}
-   *Side Note* I really need to stop getting pizza for lunch. -\_-
-   After class, there was **Game Night**. Not a single junior came
    (surprisingly), but this was fine with me because I felt as though I
    had all the fellows and seniors to myself. We first tried playing
    this weird spelling card game but we just ended up quitting mid way
    through - shocker there. Then I played 2 lovely games of Avalon
    where I got the chance to play bloody Mordred (that dude is super
    creepy looking) in both games. Craziness. I’m a terrible liar in
    reality, but I feel I’ve gotten just a tad bit more deceptive
    playing this game. &gt;:)
    -   He’s the original Voldemort!
        ![Mordred](http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q231/ivycrowned/Avalon/mordred.jpg){.aligncenter}
-   *Side Note* I keep coming up with these small web app ideas every
    week and my desire to implement all of them one by one keeps
    growing. For the mean time though, I’m just keeping them as a handy
    [`Alternote`](http://alternoteapp.com/ "Alternote"). ***You’ll be
    alive soon enough, my little inklings!***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Five - Friday {#dayfive-friday}
-----------------

-   No class today because of the 4th of the July. -\_-
-   But I got to go to Coney Island with the Tia and Tio. I had some
    good pizza, rode 3 different rides, and saw a lot of different faces
    (that’s the best part).
-   I’m making it a goal to work on the trip planner app more tomorrow
    **for sure**.
