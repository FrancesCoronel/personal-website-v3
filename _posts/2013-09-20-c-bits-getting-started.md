Hello. Hello. Hello.
====================

It’s been a while, but no worries. Once again, I’m here to make
programming a little easier by providing the literal solutions…

I’ve decided to use better resources so that my programs can be more
easily shared.

The obvious solution of course was to use GitHub – git it?!

Any who, here I will provide the questions and then you can go to the
necessary GitHub repository that I uploaded and download the program
files - yay! :D

The [solution
files](https://github.com/fvcproductions/BITS/tree/master/C-Bits/Part-I "Solution Files | C Bits Part 1")
also include the question as a comment on top and can be found on my
GitHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem 1.1 - Compute division**

Why is the result 0.000? Please fix it.

    #include
    float answer; /*The result of our calculation*/
    int main() {
      answer = 1/8;
      printf("The value of  1/8 is  %f\n", answer);
      return 0;
    }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem 1.2 - Wrong output**

Why does the program print “The answer is –1073745604”?

Values will vary.

Please fix it, so it displays the correct result.

    #include
    int answer; /*The result of our calculation*/
    int main() {
      answer = 3 + 9;
      printf("The answer is %d\n");
      return 0;
    }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem 1.3 - A compile error**

You will get compiler errors, when you try to compile the given  code
example below.

Read the error messages that the compiler produces and fix the errors,
so your source code compiles sucessfully.

Then fix the program to print the correct result.

    #include
    float result;  /* The result of the division */
    int main() {
      result = 6/23.0;
      printf("The result is %d\n", result);
      return 0;
    }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem 1.4 - Simple arithmetics**

Write a program that:

    1. assigns 13 to a and 9 to b
    2. computes the sum of a and b and prints the result
    3. computes the product of a and b and prints the result
    4. computes the difference of a and b and prints the result
    5. computes the division of a and b and prints the result (the result should be a float)
    6. computes the remainder of the division of a and b and prints the result
    7. prints the values of a and b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem 1.5 - Using  printf for multiple data types and conversions**

Write a program that:

    1. declares and initializes an integer variable a with 123, and prints the value of a over 7 places
    2. declares and intializes an float variable b with −89.6548754, and prints the value of b over 10 places and with a floating point precision of 4
    3. declares and initializes a char variable c with 'b', and prints the character on the screen
    4. declares and intializes a double variable d with  19.987243, and prints the value of d with a floating point precision of 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem 1.6 - Printing  a char as character and as decimal value**

Write a program that:

    1. declares and intializes a char variable  letter with 'a' and prints it on the screen as a character and as corresponding ASCII code
    2. declares and initializes an integer variable a with 123, and prints the value of a over 7 places
    3. declares and initializes a char variable letter with 'a' and prints it on the screen as a character and as corresponding ASCII code
