What is that [TAPIA Conference](http://tapiaconference.org/ "Tapia Confernece")?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, the 2015 Richard Tapia Conference is this conference that
promotes diversity in computing. It has been ongoing annually since
2001. The guy that the conference is named after is [Richard
Tapia](http://tapiaconference.org/about/tapia "Richard Tapia"), who is
this Mexican American math professor at Rice who is apparently pretty
effective when it comes to promoting diversity outreach in STEM fields.

Taking their goals from their website…

*The goal of the Tapia Conferences is to bring together undergraduate
and graduate students, faculty, researchers, and professionals in
computing from all backgrounds and ethnicities to:*

-   *Celebrate the diversity that exists in computing*
-   *Connect with others with common backgrounds, ethnicities,
    disabilities, and gender so as to create communities that extend
    beyond the conference;*
-   *Obtain advice from and make contacts with computing leaders in
    academia and industry;*
-   *Be inspired by great presentations and conversations with leaders
    with common backgrounds.*

Day 1 - Wednesday, February 18
------------------------------

Norfolk from up high is pretty cool looking with all the snow
everywhere.

![Norfolks the real
MVP](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/norfolk-from-above.jpg){.aligncenter}

When I get to Philadelphia, my flight to Boston gets delayed… twice. I
end up having to book a slightly earlier flight through Customer
Service, but the whole delay was a first.

![Foundation
Yeti](http://senlinonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/foundation-yeti.png){.aligncenter}

⛄️ When I get to Boston, I get the idea that the Yeti (not the one from
Foundation, just THE Yeti) lives there because it looks like this from
the plane…

![Yeti Lives
Here](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/yeti-lives-here.jpg){.aligncenter}

Needless to say, “this snow don’t play”.

Once I arrive in Boston, I end up hopping on a shared van that the Texas
A&M students were using. I didn’t even have to pay for anything because
the driver assumed I was with the students. First win.

The best part about the trip to the hotel was that the driver LOOKED and
TALKED exactly like the character Gru from [Despicable
Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me "Despicable Me"). It was
AWESOME. It was really hard to stop myself from LOL every time I heard
him talk. The massive amounts of snow everywhere was just secondary to
the experience of seeing a real-life Gru. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a
pic of him because that would have been kinda awkward since I was
sitting in shotgun.

![Real Gru &gt; Animated
Gru](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/220/2/1/despicable_me_gru_render_by_chrez-d7u8z7e.png){.aligncenter}

Once I arrive at the hotel free-riding, I check into the hotel and then
register. My lanyard, like with the triple AI conference, has the same
organization associated with my name - **FVCproductions**. How nice.

![Lanyard](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/my-lanyard1.jpg){.aligncenter}

At this point, I have roughly 3 hours left until the scholarship
recipient orientation. My roommate/buddy, [Anisha Carter]{}, who is also
from Hampton gets to the hotel soon after and I help her get started. I
tell her I won’t be able to attend the ‘Welcome Reception & Fireside
Chat’ or the ‘Desert & Career Fair’ session because I’ll be meeting up
with my cousin who lives in Boston.

![Boston is
nice.](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/boston-from-above.jpg){.aligncenter}

*The first thing I notice about the orientation is that there are a lot
of minorities, mostly Hispanics and blacks that are relatively
attractive. I’m biased because I’m a heterosexual Latina, but seriously,
a lot of people here are young and fresh looking.* \#tapia2015

![My 1st official
event.](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/scholarship-reception.jpg){.aligncenter}

My cousin is late so I attend part of the welcoming reception and then
end up having to awkwardly leave in the middle of it. Eventually meeting
up with my coz though was great since we have so much to catch up on.
I’m full half way through our Thai dinner.

Anisha tells me the next day a semi-interesting story about meeting this
short Hispanic guy named George who invited her and someone she met at
TAPIA out to drink beer while she was exploring the [Copley
Place](http://www.simon.com/mall/copley-place "Copley Place"). But I
guess that’s what happens when you take a picture of a pile of snow and
reveal you’re a tourist to everyone around you. 😏

Day 2 - Thursday, February 19
-----------------------------

### Highlights

-   **Diversity Tales and Advice from the Trenches: Experiences of
    Underrepresented Minorities in Computing** There was a talk
    following the meal break that was HILARIOUS. The speakers were so
    down to earth and **real** about what specifically they faced in
    their experiences as a minority in tech. Two of the speakers, [Juan
    Gilbert](http://www.juangilbert.com/ "Juan G"), and [Manuel
    Perez-Quiñones](http://perez.cs.vt.edu/ "Manuel PQ") were just
    ridiculously funny, I found myself laughing a lot throughout their
    spheels. There was actually this one part where they talk about
    ‘statistics’ and that if there was anybody that talked about the
    negative statistics associated with minorities, then you ought to go
    ahead and give out some ‘statistics’ out too. For example, which
    race most represents serial killers? Which race most represents
    teachers that engage in sexual affairs with their students?
    Apparently, the answers are white males and white females,
    respectively. Right back at ya.
-   **Career Fair - Resumes** There was a printer back in the lobby that
    students went to print their resumes out. 20 pages flowed out of the
    printer at some point for only one person. These people really take
    the initiative. I print out 6 and then proceed to get rid of all of
    them (however I can). I pass my resume out to Facebook, Intel,
    Bloomberg, Texas A&M, Twitter, and Microsoft. I tell one of the
    people at the IBM booth that he looks kinda like [Tristan
    Walker](https://twitter.com/tristanwalker "Tristan Walker") and he
    responds pretty apathetically which makes the idea of working at IBM
    just slightly less appealing. It’s a pretty shallow reaction on my
    part.

Tristan is the coolest.\[/caption\]

-   **Career Fair - Wayne** I had a really great talk with somebody
    called Wayne from Bloomberg because I was able to really chat with
    the guy. I mentioned my side project, [Bootcamp.Me]{}. I was really
    surprised to find out he knew who
    [David](https://twitter.com/dyang "David Yang") from [Fullstack
    Academy](https://twitter.com/fullstack "Fullstack Academy") was. I
    mean, once I found that out, I didn’t really want to stop talking to
    him because I was excited to see that he was involved in reaching
    out to the community. He also really added on what I was talking
    about all the time. Regardless, it was nice finding out Bloomberg
    was trying harder to reach out to the NYC web dev community. Also,
    much swag was received. Twitter really had A-game in terms of swag
    available today. Overall, the career fair was definitely game,
    mainly because of Wayne. Haha, rhymes.

Day 3 - Friday, February 20
---------------------------

### Highlights

-   **Hispanics in Computing **It was nice being in a room full of
    Latinos. So many different backgrounds. Most were Mexican or Puerto
    Rican. I was the only Peruvian. [Manuel
    Pérez-Quiñones](http://perez.cs.vt.edu/ "Manuel PQ") was the head of
    this meeting though so that was nice because he seemed pretty down
    to earth so far. As of right now, the only thing they have to
    communicate with the 300+ members they have is [this emailing
    list](http://mail.cs.fiu.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/hispanicsincomputing "HIC Emailing"). At
    this point, I decide I resent email because I think it’s holding
    people back. I suggested [Slack](http://slack.com "Slack") after the
    conference ended and this is the response I got:\
    \[code language="plain"\]Thanks for your input on this. Over the
    years we have had several proposals similar to yours... I like
    email, as bad and disorganized as it is, because I can "shape" it
    into different ways to do my job. I, personally, don't like other
    sites because I forget to check them. Email is centralized (all my
    email accounts go to one place).

    We already have a Facebook group\
    https://www.facebook.com/groups/HispanicsInComputing/

    And we also have a Twitter account\
    @HispanicsInComp

    I don't think most people even know we had those two and some are
    not updated with any frequency.

    We have 300+ people in the list, so it will be hard to move
    everybody to something different.

    But, if you want to start a group on/with Slack.com for the group,
    and manage it, I am sure some will follow you... those that exist on
    both sites can cross post things of interest.

Slide](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/hic-pres.jpg){.aligncenter}

-   **When working for diversity in CS becomes your day job** I saw the
    President of Harvey Mudd at this talk where university
    professors/chairs/deans/presidents/leaders in general talked about
    their experience in increasing diversity in their STEM programs. I
    remember seeing the President on a brochure for Harvey Mudd I
    received back in high school. It mentioned that she skateboarded
    around campus. I definitely got that feeling when I saw her in
    person, you know the feeling she was someone who could potentially
    skateboard around campus. Pretty cool.

![](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/working-for-diversity.jpg){.aligncenter}

-   **Increasing Diversity in the K–20 Computing Pipeline: Sharing
    Strategies & Good Practices** Here a bunch of people ended up
    speaking which was great because I have a short term attention span
    and listening to one person talk for hours on end is never something
    I’ve particularly enjoyed unless they were ridiculously good. I even
    saw Nancy, who was somebody I recognized from a Google Hackathon I
    went to last November.

<!-- -->

-   **Career Fair - All the Swag in the World** Today, Anisha and I
    decided it would be a grand idea to get a whole bunch of
    swag/flyers/brochures/etc. from all the booths to bring back to our
    university. So there I went, frolicking about that spacious room,
    collecting everything and anything I could get my hands on. I told
    them I was trying to get some stuff for my department and their eyes
    lit up at the opportunity since the career fair was almost done for
    the conference. The issue now was how to get all this back on the
    plane. Oh, decisions, decisions.

<!-- -->

-   **Banquet** This was it. The final event. The way they serve our
    food this time is the fanciest by far. Did I mention all the food
    was great? It definitely was. They even had enough vegetarian
    options to keep me more than satisfied, which is a rare thing. After
    we eat, the final speaker,
    [Freeman](http://president.umbc.edu/ "Freeman"), gives the best
    speech I’ve heard so far in the entire conference. He really covered
    a lot of great points. Anyhow, having been inspired by **THE
    Freeman**, [Richard](http://www.caam.rice.edu/~rat/ "Richard") talks
    about his background and basically covers the main points of his
    life story and how he got to where he was. I didn’t realize he had
    lost his daughter throughout the period where he was getting more
    and more accolades. That was pretty sad. Awards were then given out
    and people got cool things such as [Google
    Chromecasts](http://www.google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/ "Google Chromcast"),
    [Lenovo
    Tablets](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/tablets/ "Lenovo Tablets"), an
    [Xbox one](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one "Xbox One"), other
    cool swag I can’t remember off the top of my head.

<!-- -->

-   **Dancing** Following the banquet, there was dancing, and boy oh
    boy, do I love to dance. Unfortunately, the song selection could
    have been a bit catchier, but I guess beggars can’t be choosers,
    whatever that really means. Regardless, I got to see Latinos who
    REALLY knew how to dance and awkward Harvard students move their
    hips too. SO all in all, it wasn’t that disappointing. Since I’m
    lame, I get tired pretty fast and end up getting to bed around 11
    pm.

Day 4 - Saturday, February 21
-----------------------------

### Highlights

Today really sucked because my plane got delayed 6 hours so when I
should have arrived home at 3 pm, I actually arrived around 9 pm. Get
ready for an airport horror story.

The first time I got into the plane, we were a few minutes from lifting
off when the airport decides it’s not safe to fly. We wait for half an
hour back in the terminal and then it’s finally decided we have to
deplane.

Consistently throughout the process, I faced the dilemma of whether or
not to take the initiative on finding a different flight or just sayin’
“screw it, let me get some pizza and a smoothie or something to pass the
time (which I did do once or twice - I mean,
[Sbarro's](http://www.sbarro.com/ "Sbarro's") is just irresistible)”. I
eventually decided to try and get a different flight through customer
service.

![Mmmhmmm.](https://sunnyyq.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12-08-31-new-york-style-mozzarella-cheese-pizza-sbarro.jpg){.aligncenter}

Half way through waiting in this 1-hour line, I call this help line \#
that this lady from Toronto gives me since the help line only helps with
domestic flights. It’s officially from US Airways but then the help line
goes on to offer me a \$100 Walmart gift card and insisting that I give
them my personal info to get this card. I’m pretty gullible, so I give
them my name and address but then they ask for my debit card \# and I go
crazy and ask why they haven’t help me out yet. I’m still in the
ridiculously long line and hang up on the stupid help line and then all
of a sudden, US Airways announces that the flight I’ve been waiting for
4 hours so far now is now boarding.

![And Im off after a zillion
hours](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/leaving-to-norfolk.jpg){.aligncenter}

When I got home, I took all my anger out on the snow which wasn’t really
a fun process either.

![In Mother Russia, snow punches

Conclusion
==========

The Tapia Conference really ended up being a grand time. I met some cool
people, like Britney and
[Sean](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sean-lawrence/62/746/603 "Sean Lawrence"),
who I friended on LinkedIn. I even ended up joining 2 organizations,
[Hispanics in
Computing](http://mail.cs.fiu.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/hispanicsincomputing "HIC Emailing")
and [Afro Movers &
Shakers](http://afmvskrs.slack.com "Afro Movers & Shakers"). I’m hoping
to help out HIC out because they only have a e-mail listserv right now
which isn’t very effective in distributing information. I actually ended
up recommending [Slack](http://slack.com "Slack") to the organizer of
Afro Movers & Shakers and he thought it was a cool idea and made one.

With all the swag, flyers, and brochures I received from the conference,
Anisha and I were able to decorate the CS department more effectively,
kind of like a refurbishing of the entire area. We can also now use the
swag we received as a way to offer prizes for any events we have for our
[ACM Student Chapter](http://huacm.wordpress.com "HU ACM").
