------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **How many drop out after simply experiencing the pre-work? How much
    time should I dedicate to the pre-work?**You have pre-work.
    Realistically, dedicating 50–100 total hours is ideal for pre-work.
    Nobody has dropped out after experiencing pre-work. There have been
    family emergencies, unfortunate situations, but nothing directly
    correlated to Coding Dojo.
2.  **How many college students have you had in the past?**Quite a few,
    more recently so. We have coordinated our schedule to do that. The
    average age is 25–30.
3.  **What would you say are the key differences between the two
    campuses?**The campus in Mountain View is the sort of super center
    and class sizes can go up to 30. Here in Seattle they go up to 25.
    Besides that, there’s not much difference.
4.  **What kind of process do your instructors go through?**Most
    instructors will have quite a few years in development experience.
5.  **What is your background? How were introduced into the tech/web
    development scene?**I’m a graduate of Coding Dojo with a background
    in Management. I always wanted to get into computers, but my father
    wanted me to get into finance and wanted me to get an MBA. I ended
    up taking 6 months off and found myself coding. One thing led into
    another and I started looking into coding bootcamps. I loved it. It
    was a great experience. The synergy between students is amazing.
    People really are motivated to move forward and try and understand
    things. There is lots of desire and passion with good attitude
    present.
6.  **What do you guys recommend students do outside of the course?**We
    discourage students getting into Meetups because we want them to
    stick with the program and do as expected - every single hour is
    vital. Once you graduate, you can immerse yourselves in Meetups and
    Hackathons and such because then it will make more sense. Before and
    after - the difference in skill is massive. Hacakathons are always
    great, but the schedule is just so busy and structured so there
    won’t be enough time. The more you code, the better.
7.  **What’s the idea behind founding this program? What made you think
    it was a good idea?**The founder’s idea was that he wanted to
    transform people’s lives and offer the ability to make it better.
    Development is just one vision in that. Anyone can be a developer
    and develop something. From 0 to 100, as long as that person is
    motivated, driven, you can move forward. Even with 0 knowledge, we
    can transform people’s lives and teach people that they can go back
    and get into computers. The graduates have experienced that.
8.  **Anything else? **There is 20 minute rule - it’s the idea that if
    you’re there coding, and that you’re stuck, you need to spend 20
    minutes to figure out that problem (60–70% of students solve it at
    that point). If after 20 minutes, you can’t figure it out, there are
    2people that you can ask for help. A lot of problems that were
    goingto be asked don’t get asked and helps the student strengthen
    that knowledge. It’s the most efficient way so that peopleare forced
    to learn things.We teach the LAMP stack, which is basic. From that
    we move to Node.js. Then we move to Ruby on Rails last. There is a
    desire and need for Ruby on Rails and it’s unique because it’s a
    high level language. There are shortcuts and a little amount of code
    required. For example in PHP 15–20 lines equates to 1 line of code
    in Ruby. Same with SQL (15–20 lines) and then that converts to 5–6
    lines on Active Record. When students write code, they know whats
    going on and how they can go about fixing it.
