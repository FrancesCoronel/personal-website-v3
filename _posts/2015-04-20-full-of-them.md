I mean, I've kinda known **that** for a while.

But seriously?

I recently stumbled upon this Chrome extension called
*[Nothing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nothing/mabenbhpjlchigbbpafligkdnlhjbmel?hl=en-US "Nothing | Chrome Extension")*
and guess what it does?

Yes, it does **SOMETHING**.

And that **SOMETHING** is absolutely **NOTHING**!!!

YARHARHAR.

Good one, Internet.
