So I live in Norfolk, Virginia which is this beautiful small town by the
sea. Norfolk is part of the Hampton Roads area which is often referred
to as the `757` since that's our catchy area code.

Norfolk has a growing developer community, but it has yet to really
establish a culture for them. This is where conferences usually come in.

Having said that, **[HR DevFest](https://hrdevfest.org "HRDevFest")**,
the **first major tech conference catering to the `757` area**, was
actually **today** on November 14th, 2015 from 8:30 am to 6 pm.

It's always exciting to potentially be part of an inaugural anything so
when the organizers behind HR DevFest announced their call for
presentations, I decided to give it a shot for the heck of it and
submitted my proposal on a web design talk that I had presented while at
[Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy").

I was surprised by the amount of support I received from the community
for the proposal and before I knew it, I had gotten the opportunity to
speak for the first time at an official tech conference.

I've spoken at conferences before, but never at an actual tech
conference which is why victory was that much sweeter when I finally got
the opportunity to do so today. So…
