=======================================================================================================

> This is where I’ll go through how my admissions process was with
> Fullstack.
>
> I’ll be doing this with every bootcamp I’ve applied to and be
> critiquing along the way. I think it’s important that people have an
> honest look at each bootcamp.
>
> That being said, I’m not releasing anything here without Fullstack’s
> permission.
>
> My experience with Fullstack has been the best so far in terms of the
> overall admissions process, so they’ll be my first so I can head off
> to a positive start with all this reviewing. 😁

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1: The Application 📝
-------------------------

-   You fill out the virtual application for Fullstack
    [here](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/apply "Apply to Fullstack Academy").
    It involves filling out basic background info such as education,
    social links, coding abilities, employment status, post-Fullstack
    plans, and a small essay question as to why you’d be a great fit for
    Fullstack.
-   Once you fill this out, they’ll send you an email shortly afterwards
    where you will schedule a virtual interview through Skype with the
    admissions officer,
    [Huntly](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/huntly-mayo-malasky/24/852/b5a "Huntly - Admissions @Fullstack").
-   The process overall was clean, efficient, and very organized. No
    problems here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2: The Interview 📞
-----------------------

So besides the 3 coding challenges I was given and answering any
questions about myself and my background, I was also given the chance to
ask Huntly some questions. I thought the coding questions were
challenging and they reassured me that Fullstack was a competitive
program. Huntly was also a very nice/informative guy and I did not feel
uncomfortable at all throughout the process. It was nice knowing he knew
what he was talking about since he’s a Fullstack grad himself.

When I did end up asking Huntly some questions, here what’s he had to
say:

> answers taken from my interview are paraphrased or just referenced
> straight by mouth from Huntly
>
> personal comments are highlighted `like this`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Yield rate - out of the applicants you accept, what percentage end
    up attending?**\

    > 80%\
    > `Nice!`

2.  **How many drop out after simply experiencing the pre-work?**\

    > Since we do base our main coursework off the pre-work so we try to
    > select people that we feel can handle the pre-work, which is
    > typically 15–20 hours a week. I don’t think anyone has dropped out
    > yet in that process.

3.  **How many college students have you had in the past?**\

    > We’ve had a couple in the last summer cohort. For the upcoming
    > summer cohort, we’re planning on having a separate group
    > compromised of just college students.\*\*

4.  **Why the ‘no asshole’ rule? Details?**\

    > It’s actually a reference to this book called [“The No Asshole
    > Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That
    > Isn’t”](http://www.amazon.com/The-Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace/dp/0446698202 "The Asshole Rule")
    > and we believe the mentality described in the book forms an ideal
    > culture here at Fullstack.
    > `#1 best seller on Amazon in the Business Etiquette category!`

5.  **What kind of process do your instructors go through?**\

    > We screen for good developers who have open source contributions.
    > We want to see clear examples that they know how to code and that
    > they have significant teaching experience. We’ll ask them to teach
    > them something on the spot by writing it out (something random).
    > They’ll interview with the founders, Nimit and David and also give
    > trial lessons to a bootcamp cohort. We’ll then get feedback from
    > the students directly to see if they liked the trial lesson. We
    > won’t even specifically tell the students if it’s a person
    > interviewing to be an instructor, we just let them know they’re a
    > ‘guest lecturer’.

6.  **How much of the day will a student at Fullstack be spending
    coding?**\

    > I’d say in the first half of the program, students will usually
    > spend about 2/3 of their time coding and 1/3 on lectures and
    > review. In the later half of the program though, they’ll be in
    > their project phase and that’s where they’re probably going to be
    > spending 80% of their time coding.

7.  **Talk to me more about the CTO program that you build in with every
    cohort.**\

    > The CTO program is there to make sure that students know how to
    > approach coding from any aspect that is given to them, and that
    > coding is not just about programming per se, but about helping the
    > community and contributing in many different frameworks/aspects.
    > So with the CTO program, we are emphasizing to students that
    > they’re just not trying to become great programmers, but great
    > contributors to the community they end up joining and
    > understanding the code is just one part of the larger process when
    > it comes to startups and leading in the tech scene in general.

8.  **What do you guys recommend students do outside of the course?**\

    > We have our own [Meetup group based at
    > Fullstack](http://www.meetup.com/fullstack-javascript/ "Fullstack Meetup")
    > and we encourage our students to attend local Meetups that relate
    > to JavaScript or programming in general. Students will even
    > lecture or present projects at these Meetups midway through the
    > program. We also encourage participating in Hackathons and have
    > gotten a [lot of success with our students participating in local
    > ones](http://blog.fullstackacademy.com/post/78441810309/hacks-through-history "Hackathons @Fullstack")
    > as well.

Part 3: The Decision 💡
----------------------

**I was accepted!!!** Apparently, they liked my *critical thought
process, problem-solving skills and positive attitude*. 😄

Now here are some logistics for reference:

-   Once you’re accepted and offered a spot in whatever cohort you
    applied to, you’re formally given a week or so after to register and
    secure a deposit once they’ve given you enrollment instructions. If
    you don’t answer by then, they’ll release your spot and will also
    require you to re-apply after a month or so after.
-   Securing a deposit of \$2K assures you have access to their
    ‘Fullstack Foundations’, which is a 120 hour virtual course that
    acts as the pre-work to the Fullstack main curriculum onsite and
    also secures your spot in the class.
-   Thankfully, I applied early and once I was accepted, I was required
    to meet with one the founders,
    [Nimit](https://twitter.com/nimit "Nimit - Founder @Fullstack"). He
    understood my situation that I wasn’t quite decided as to what I was
    doing yet, so I’ll be talking with him in late January again to see
    what my plans are from there.
