## Part 1: The Application 📝

- You fill out the virtual application for MakerSquare
    [here](https://makersquare.typeform.com/to/MO9OFv "App MakerSquare").
    They use a special application called
    [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/ "Typeform") for their admissions
    process, so it's pretty snazzy.
- Once you fill this app out, they'll give you the link for the 1st
    admissions challenge, which was very simple. I think this challenge
    is just to weed out the people who didn't even try to learn how to
    program because it's supa easy.
- Once I submitted that 1st challenge, I was asked to schedule my
    first interview with Shaan Shah, one of the co-founders. I'll be
    sharing the Q&A session I had with Shaan and that's basically what
    the 1st interview was about - a get to know you and answering any
    questions I had about the bootcamp.
- **It doesn't stop there!** 😁
- After the 1st interview, I was given a 2nd admissions challenge.
    Compared to the 1st one, this one was pretty hard. You had to learn
    enough jQuery to complete it and I didn't know coming in I would
    have to learn another technology. It's all good, though. After a few
    days or more of struggling, I cracked it and finished the 2nd
    challenge. I wasn't able to complete one aspect of it, but I
    finished 95% of it.
- After completing the 2nd challenge, I was scheduled for my 2nd and
    final interview with a recent grad of MakerSquare, [Daniel O.]{}.
    This is where my technical abilities were challenged a bit. I'm not
    going to spoil anything but on a scale of 1–10, 10 being super hard,
    I'd say it was a 5.5/10. One question was a little harder than I was
    prepared for, but everything was pretty straight forward. The cool
    part about this interview was that we didn't use Skype, we used
    [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/ "Screenhero"), which is
    definitely the most ideal tech to use in this situation since you
    can manipulate the screen of the interviewees and see how they work
    out the problem. This is a great way to also verify that what they
    did was genuine. It reminded me of Fullstack's approach in the
    technical challenge as well where they used their own software to
    see how I programmed in real-time.
- Following this technical session, I was given another email that
    asked what cohort I was applying to for sure and they reminded me
    that they would giving me an answer whether or not I was accepted
    soon since that the technical session is the final step.

## Part 2: The Interview 📞 with [Shaan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaanshah "Shaan Shah")

The first interview focuses solely on getting to know each other and my
goals for MakerSquare, etc.

The second interview focused solely on the coding challenges and
assessing technical ability. I was able to ask a few questions
pertaining to his specific cohort experience, but the majority of my
questions were answered by Shaan.

> answers were paraphrased or just referenced verbatim\
> personal comments are highlighted `like this`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Yield rate - out of the applicants you accept, what percentage of
    that end up attending?** 85–90%. There are roughly 20–30 applicants
    for every student ultimately selected. And there are 200 or so
    applicants for a class of about 18 people. We try to keep our
    classes small with about 15–20 students max. Roughly speaking, this
    year we've had about 1000 applicants for only 180 spots. So, all in
    all, an increasing number of students are applying, but the
    admissions process is becoming more competitive simultaneously as
    well. `Nifty.`
2. **How many drop out after simply experiencing the pre-work? How much
    time should I dedicate to the pre-work?** Not many people drop out
    at all. Although the pre-work is intended to weed out the ones who
    are not prepared. `Indeed.` It's also to make sure that every
    student comes in comfortably into the program and is ready to tackle
    harder problems. Students typically are supposed to work about a
    couple hours a day for 2 months on the pre-work.
3. **How many college students have you had in the past?** At least a
    few, some in Austin. There were 3, I believe, that were currently in
    college or recent graduates. We had one in the last summer cohort
    for San Francisco as well. One of the students who ended up going
    back to school told us that the program had opened his eyes to a lot
    of things, which was great. Right now, we're actually trying to find
    a way to bring in more college students to our program.
    `Yes, all the bootcamps I've applied to seem to be interested in recruiting more kiddies like me. 😊`
4.  **What would you say are the key differences between the campus?**
    Both locations are pretty similar in structure. As of right now,
    there are smaller classes in San Francisco (about 15 versus \~18 in
    Austin) to make sure that before there are more students involved,
    the curriculum is perfected. They are run independently and there
    are lots of interesting positions and opportunities available in San
    Francisco, which are the primary reasons we are expanding there. A
    big motivation of ours is to serve our students in the best possible
    way so right now. `I'm applying for San Fran.`
5.  **What kind of process do your instructors go through?** We'll have
    them give sample lessons with students before they are hired.
    Current students should be comfortable with their teaching methods.
    We want to see they have a balanced experience with teaching
    beginners and that they have mentored others individually and what
    they've developed on their own.
6.  **What is your background? How were introduced into the tech/web
    development scene?** I majored in Accounting and Finance in college.
    Immediately upon graduation, I got involved in the startup scene and
    noticed that more technical skills were needed to build these
    projects, so I tried immersing myself in the software development
    area. I actually went through [Starter
    League](https://www.starterleague.com "Starter League") in Chicago
    back when they had part-time classes. That's essentially how I
    transitioned from finance to software.
7.  **What do you guys recommend students do outside of the course?** We
    have a lot of people come in: guest lecturers, presenters, speakers,
    and such. We do have Meetups on a monthly basis and this is where
    our students can also present projects. Depending on the group, we
    can have anything from sports going on to yoga or running. We don't
    want to enforce any particular lifestyle on any single cohort. There
    will be game nights sometimes, it all just depends on the student
    dynamic. What we do want is making sure each student is being fully
    immersed and going all in with trying to learn how to code, and that
    involves socializing and meeting up with the tech community. Team
    dynamic is really important. We also have internal hackathons that
    are just integrated into our program because we see students getting
    a lot out of that experience and something they can bring to their
    interview as well when they're looking to get hired. We typically
    have at least 2 hackathons per cohort but depending on the students,
    we'll have 3 in total sometimes.
8.  **Do you have any meetings just between the cohort and founders?**
    We have different stand-ups where people will present projects and
    any challenges they had. The teams can share their challenges in
    order to help each other and collaborate with the code they're
    working on as well.

Part 3: The Decision 💡
----------------------

I was accepted!!! ☺️ Woot, woot! I think I was able to prove that I was
ready during the technical interview since
[Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/ "Screenhero") was the best tool to
showcase what kind of programmer I was.

Here's part of the email they sent me:

    I hope you are doing well!  I have very good news, we would like to admit you to MakerSquare's summer 2015 cohort.  I do want to let you know about a change to your cohort's start date.   Rather than starting on May 26th, you will now start on June 1st.

    The decision to adjust the start date was to provide our instructors a week gap for preparation between the end of the prior class and the start of your class. It will help us ensure that each class starts off on the right foot, and things are seamless from the beginning. We're really excited to be able to do this going forward. The program still remains as a 12 week program.
