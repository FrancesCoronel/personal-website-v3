 These are interesting times.
=============================

After applying and interviewing for a bunch of internships and coding
bootcamps and receiving a bunch of rejections and acceptances, I’ve
decided to head to [Fullstack
Academy](http://fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy") this summer
which is located in New York City to be part of their inaugural class
for their [Summer of
Code](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/summer-of-code "Fullstack Academy | Summer of Code")
program. Ok, wow, that was a mouthful![![Summer of Code | Fullstack
Academy](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/summer-of-code-fullstack-academy.png){.aligncenter}](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/summer-of-code-fullstack-academy.png)

It’s only for college kiddies and surprisingly there’s not many programs
designated specifically for us, so it’s pretty cool that Fullstack
decided to implement this.

Read [Quote of Huntly Mayo Malasky's answer to Are there are any coding
bootcamps for college
students?](http://www.quora.com/Are-there-are-any-coding-bootcamps-for-college-students/answer/Huntly-Mayo-Malasky/quote/3466710)
on [Quora](http://www.quora.com)

It was a big decision and was not to be taken lightly. My parents
supported me throughout the whole process and for that, I’m
appreciative.

I’m hoping to finally gain those “practical skills” in web development
so I can finally start implementing all the ideas I have for potential
web apps!

If everything goes as planned, senior year is going to fly by! :wink:
