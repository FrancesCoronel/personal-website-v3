So if you’re not already familiar with Robert Green’s popular book "[The
48 Laws of
Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power "48 Laws of Power - Wiki")"
that was published in 1998, I’m going to suggest you read it… right now.

Like any popular book, it has its positive and negative criticisms, but
I found it immensely interesting for a self-help book.

I felt some of the laws mentioned had some real merit so I decided to go
ahead and share some of them to let you decide yourself.

All credit goes to Robert Greene for the laws.

I just included my 20 favorite ones so that if you want to read the
book, you can still get surprised.

Here they are then…

##### 1. Never Outshine The Master

##### 2. Be Wary Of Friends For They Will Betray You Faster

##### 3. Learn How To Use Enemies For They Have More to Prove

##### 4. Conceal Your Emotions

##### 5. Always Say Less Than Necessary

##### 6. Never Do Yourself What Others Can Do For You

##### 7. Use Selective Honesty & Generosity

##### 8. Crush Your Rival Completely & Totally

##### 9. Be Unpredictable

##### 10. Isolation is Dangerous

##### 11. Do Not Offend The Wrong Person

##### 12. Keep Your Own Hands Clean

##### 13. Plan Ahead To The End

##### 14. Make Any Accomplishment Seem Effortless

##### 15. Play Along

##### 16. Discover Weaknesses

##### 17. Think Differently, Behave Commonly
