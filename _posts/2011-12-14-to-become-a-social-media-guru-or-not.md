**However, I was accepted to the VA Governor School for Math, Science,
and Technology the following year, when I decided to apply a second time
using the following essay instead. This essay talks about social
networking in the classroom basically. Unfortunately, even though I had
tried again to get accepted, I was unable to attend the summer program.
This essay was finished December 14, 2011.**

## To become a social media guru or not?

When one thinks about future classrooms and education formatting,
technology will be undoubtedly the founding basis. Let’s face it,
technology has effectively become capable of controlling every aspect of
life now, whether it be work, family, friends or even education. Online
learning with its videos and valuable resources along with interactive
approaches such as with the Wii or Kinect have shown that the
traditional lecture idea has evolved into something more adaptable to
the generation of today. The majority of educators today, along with
myself, believe Facebook is part of the group that is helping speed that
evolution process. In fact, what is starting to stem from large social
websites like Facebook should never be limited to teachers.     With
good reason, colleges and schools are already starting to catch along
with the fast growing rate of e-learning. Schools globally have made
themselves more accessible to the public and their students by making
themselves various groups (usually with the particular class as the
group name) in Twitter and Facebook. With the inviting atmosphere
Facebook offers, more collaboration is possible between teachers and
pupil , not just because the student feels they can speak their mind
more freely but because it can also boost teacher security when students
no longer cringe at the thought of discussions and teachers can share
the wealth of their knowledge in a more informal bonding manner. As for
the extremely shy students that every classroom has, Facebook has the
ability to give these introverts a chance to excel through online
enlightenment with their teacher as well.

Methods of how students and teachers use Facebook expand every day, from
photo tagging to creating groups. Students have taken photos of notes or
if in a science class, of their laboratory work/equipment, and have
referred them in their photo albums by uploading, captioning, and
sharing them through Facebook. While texting does the trick of
notifications most of the time, Facebook also provides a class buddy
system so students communicate with their project or study groups via
the instant messaging tool. Among more obvious uses, students and
teachers can also form groups for easier reference when dealing with a
particular subject and receive access to assignments, activities, and
updates in general on the page walls of their teachers. So not only do
teachers have the ability to get a better grasp of their students’
personalities, but can also co-construct knowledge in an online format
students may have more flexibility with, such as with scheduling or
class notes. It is a loss for the students when the teacher doesn’t have
a easy way of instant and easy feedback for their students and Facebook
provides just that.

It is essential that current generation make the best use of their
technological abundance, not to just to make it easier for themselves,
but for everyone else as well. Facebook is only the first step in the
education revolution that plays itself out now.

**So here's the moral of the story -- write shorter essays to actually
get accepted into summer gov school and then once accepted, actually fit
time into schedule to be able to attend. Bam.**
