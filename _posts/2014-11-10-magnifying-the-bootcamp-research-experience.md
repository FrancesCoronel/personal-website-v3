The Coding Bootcamp Ultimatum {#the-coding-bootcamp-ultimatum style="text-align:center;"}
=============================

Okay, so on my search for the perfect **coding bootcamp** (I’m just
going to refer to it as **CB**) last year and now again this year, I
used/am using several different websites.

So today we’ll be looking at each of these compare/finder websites for
CBs by analyzing the prominent [**Hack
Reactor**](https://hackreactor.com) bootcamp on each website.

For each of these sites, I’ll be annotating the design interface
directly with my personal critiques (**if I have any to give**) just
because there’s always room for improvement, and you know, why not?
Green annotations = good , red = bad (typical).

The 3 criteria I’m judging these sites are as follows:

1.  **UI (User Interface)**
2.  **UX (User Experience)**
3.  **High-quality content and reviews**

I think these key 3 criteria are the minimal requirements each great CB
website ought to aspire for. Mind you, this is just for the overall web
site, this isn’t for the CBs themselves, where different criteria would
obviously apply like *teacher quality*, *ROI*, *brand*, *peers*, and so
forth.

When I’m searching for a CB, It should be easy, I shouldn’t be wondering
how to do a specific task because of the design, and it should give me
enough high quality background of the bootcamp. This is so that the user
feels like they don’t have to do any extra work when it comes to
planning where they’re gonna change the rest of their lives for the next
few months.

I mean, it’s a pretty big decision, y’all! ;)

**Positives** 😄

-   purty
    -   minimal design makes for more fun
-   plenty of reviews in the comment section
    -   using the [Disqus](https://disqus.com "Disqus") platform was a
        great idea!
-   makes use of other features
    -   twitter timeline

**Negatives** 😞

-   login option
    -   there’s not really an incentive to create an account and login
        with it
-   newsletter?
    -   not much clarification as to what I’d be getting
-   very little information provided
    -   besides the basic overview and typical stats on the left or
        right sidebar, there isn’t much going on
-   no other resources provided
    -   although they do intend to release a blog soon…

**Positives** 😄

-   tons of info
    -   a general overview is given of the bootcamp along with a quick
        glance of the education, assistance, contact, and review
        specifics
-   plenty of filters for you to choose from
    -   language focus, job placement/assistance, location, country,
        price, length, and class size are offered as possible filters to
        assist your search
-   comment section at the very bottom is nice\
    - these are always a nice addition to any website and it utilizes
    the Disqus interface so even better
-   constantly updated
    -   there’s always a new bootcamp popping up

**Negatives** 😞

-   ugly UI
    -   in all honestly, it’s really not the prettiest website out there
    -   for one thing, it’s a little difficult to maneuver with the
        table for information about HackReactor being so long
-   too much information
    -   most hopefuls would benefit more from some clear necessary
        information on the Bootcamps.in website and some useful links
        for that information on the main bootcamp website rather than a
        whole slew of numbers and data that are provided
-   lots of filters but they don’t help
    -   it is nice when code camps are filtered in so many ways by cost,
        focus, location, and so on but it’s not really nice when they’re
        not filtered in a way that helps you get the most out of it
    -   with this website, you can only select one of these options so
        literally just one location, one focus, one cost and so on and
        that’s how it’s determined
    -   so basically, what I’m saying is that if you were looking for a
        JavaScript focused school that cost less than \$10K located in
        California, that would be really hard for you to actually do
        because this website only allows for one of those factors to be
        looked for specifically…

**Positives** 😄

-   well designed
    -   very minimal straightforward kind of layout that doesn’t feel
        cluttered
-   reviews, founder spotlight, student spotlight
    -   these are extremely informative for anyone who really wants a
        more inside look into the school and its culture (if there’s one
        present)
    -   it seems these are really what makes the backbone of the website
        too and is always better than just give out the basic stats on
        each coding bootcamp
-   all the relevant links are right in front of you
    -   right under the logo of the coding bootcamp along with specific
        facts that tells you whether or not the bootcamp offers job
        assistance, housing, visa assistance, and so on
-   can really narrow your search down
    -   you can use all the filters they offer at the same time to
        narrow your search down for the ideal bootcamp

**Negatives** 😞

-   minimal design, but it’s also kinda annoying
    -   when it comes to their latest news for each school as well as
        their reviews they have them both in 1 column
    -   this doesn’t allow for space and makes the idea of scrolling
        down and down to look at either seem tedious
    -   it would be ideal then (personally speaking) if they split these
        up so that the reviews were presented on the left side right
        under the vital information that showed the stars each reviewer
        gave and then an option to show the full review like with what
        they did with the “School Details”, “More Information”, and
        “Courses” section
-   fewer filters for searching
    -   location, price, focus, and type (in person or online) are the
        only filters offered

**Positives** 😄

-   different kinds of information provided
    -   no other website offers a chance to look at “Student Projects”
        or some of the actual “Hiring Partners” for the bootcamp, which
        is pretty neat!
    -   also has student reviews and the technologies you’ll learn at
        the bootcamp
-   very minimal design
    -   no clutter, much love
-   information is up to date and relevant
    -   all the programs coincide with what the bootcamp was actually
        offering, and all the information they did provide is relevant

**Negatives** 😞

-   very minimal information
    -   at least in terms of student reviews, very few were shown and no
        link was provided to direct to more so there wasn’t much I could
        go off of there
    -   student reviews or reviews in general are vital for these kind
        of websites because they provide perspective to hopefuls - but
        unfortunately the best in depth reviews I could find of some of
        these bootcamps are all located on friggin’
        [*Quora*](https://quora.com) which is fine, but they need to be
        shared with others too
-   only 2 filters
    -   by topic and city (individually, not simultaneously)
    -   otherwise, it’s just a long scrolling down of squares
        representing bootcamps with you trying to find one that appeals
        to you
-   very few bootcamps
    -   there’s roughly \~200 legitimate coding bootcamps out there
        globally (give or take), but they only preview about \~50 of the
        more well known ones

**Positives** 😄

-   really differentiates itself from the competition
    -   they offer a career quiz to help get you started (apparently I’d
        be great as someone in back-end - hehe)!
    -   they (like Course Report) offers spotlight of founders and
        student along with the latest news pertaining to whichever
        relevant bootcamp
-   thewebsite design is sooo sexy
    -   pictures of actual people - holy crap - are on each coding
        bootcamp’s representative square on the website along with extra
        hover information
    -   this actually makes scrolling down fun even if you’re just
        browsing!
-   allthe bootcamps in the world (huzzaaah!)
    -   they offer roughly \~170 bootcamps, in a very clean and
        productive manner, which is more than what I can say for the
        other websites
-   filters really work out
    -   for the subjects or focus on each bootcamp, a lot of options are
        offered along with many others under the other filters of
        location, price, and ratings
    -   all the filters can be used at once to speed up that search and
        get to researching!

**Negatives** 😞

-   notall bootcamps have information updated
    -   for the bootcamps that lack information/content, there is a
        picture of a latte and a laptop, which is fine, but there should
        still be some kind of picture that sets it apart from the rest
        of the lattes
    -   by topic and city (individually, not simultaneously)
-   how all the filters actually work
    -   that location filter
        -   in all honesty, it might be better to enforce some kind of
            zip code and mile radius because the cities selection is a
            little tedious
    -   that price filter
        -   to somebody in high places, one of these \$ might mean
            \$10,000 so I’m not a big fan of the simple \$, \$\$,
            \$\$\$, and so on unless there’s some background provided
    -   that ratings filter
        -   okay, so why would anybody want to search for a 1-star or
            2-star rated bootcamp again, just for funsies?
        -   it’s understandable that it’s there given that it correlates
            with the student reviews but…
-   limitedinformation for each bootcamp
    -   besides the stunning student review section and a basic overview
        of what the bootcamp has to offer (which is a similarity between
        all the websites), there’s not much else going on

    -   rates accelerators, tech-related books, software, accelerators,
        venture capitalists, development schools (aka coding bootcamps),
        etc. based on reviews
    -   has a [leaderboard](https://schools.techendo.com/leaderboard)
        for the top “Development Schools”
        -   according to Techendo, [HackReactor is number
            one](https://schools.techendo.com/schools/hack-reactor)
        -   …however, this is only based on 10 positive reviews, so
            still needs some more data

-   [“The Definitive Guide To Choosing a Bootcamp” -
    theFirehoseProject](https://www.thefirehoseproject.com/definitive-guide)
    -   theFirehouseProject itself is a new immersive online
        apprenticeship targeted to those who want to become a full-stack
        web developer
    -   so the bootcamp guide they offer is not an actual
        comparison/review site but rather serves as one of the first
        full guides dedicated to just researching and choosing the right
        coding bootcamp
    -   needless to say, you should definitely give it a go if you’re a
        newb to the whole CB scene, because this guide steps you through
        **everything** you need to know

-   [hack\_app](https://hackapp.co)
    -   Some CBs have it where you can quickly apply directly through
        their sites, others have more interactive applications &
        pre-work through coding challenges like with
        [MakerSquare](https://makersquare.gitbooks.io/preparing-for-makersquare/content/index.html),
        [HackReactor](https://admissions.hackreactor.com),
        [Flatiron](https://prework.flatironschool.com),
        [Fullstack](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/interview_prep),
        etc., and still others might use hack\_app, which is an
        application portal dedicated to making it easy for users to
        research and apply to CBs.
    -   So far, it only has 28 schools participating, but it has a great
        UI/UX so if you really want a swift and easy app process, I’d go
        with hack\_app.

        just for anyone who wants a really great layout of what’s
        recommend before applying and interviewing for a software
        development internship. This sort of logic applies for

-   Resources the CBs Provide
    -   Bootcamps who are really passionate about their goal tend to
        offer a serious admissions pre-interview/code
