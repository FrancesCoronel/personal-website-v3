## AlterConf | NYC 2016

### AlterConf is a traveling conference series that provides safe opportunities for marginalized people and those who support them in the tech and gaming industries. By highlighting the powerful voices and positive itetiatives of local community members, we build hope and strengthen the community’s resolve to create safer spaces for everyone.

About a month ago, I was honored to have the opportunity to freelance blog for
AlterConf NYC. The conference left me inspired and less alone, as technologists
from all walks of life surrounded me throughout the conference. Indeed,
AlterConf was hands down the **MOST** diverse conference I have ever attended
and I find this aspect to be more important than ever, especially considering
what the year 2016 has brought us.

To give you an idea of how amazing this conference was, here is a thorough
rundown of what was discussed with snippets taken from social media.

*****

### **OPENING ADDRESS**

#### **Adina Shanholtz**, [@FeyTechnologist](https://twitter.com/FeyTechnologist)<br>
**Ashe Dryden**, [@ashedryden](https://twitter.com/ashedryden)<br> **Danielle
James**, [@big_dani_j](http://twitter.com/big_dani_j)

Adina, a technical evangelist at Microsoft, opened up the conference and how she
wanted to make more diversity events like **AlterConf** happen at Microsoft.

Some rules were established by Ashe, the chief organizer of AlterConf, about the
etiquette required for the conference and making sure everyone understood that
**AlterConf** is meant to be a **safe place** for everyone.

Danielle, a marketing specialist at MongoDB and an avid shipper of diversity
initiatives, then introduced the first speaker.

### **OPENING THE INTERNET: LOOKING BEYOND ENGLISH DOMINANCE**

#### [Christina González](https://medium.com/@c_gonzalez), @c_gonzalez

The global Internet audience has been steadily changing over time. The structure
of the Internet itself, however, has been slower to catch up. Internationalized
Domain Names (IDNs), which utilize non-Latin alphabets and diacritic marks, were
proposed in the mid-90’s, but not realized until 2010. Even now, not all
services play nicely with them. In a country and a world where the Internet can
serve as a lifeline to learning tools, as well as opportunity, access must go
beyond simply connecting to the Internet.

While changes are coming, there is still widespread inconsistency in how
user-friendly to non-English speakers some of the country’s, and sometimes the
world’s, most popular sites and services are. There may be top trending hash
tags worldwide on Twitter in Arabic, but user names must be in Latin characters.
There’s a disconnect between the creators of services and spaces and today’s
current and potential audiences.

Christina addresses this from a personal perspective (Do you really need that
accent on your name?) to a wider one, points out some of these inconsistencies,
and talks about possible solutions.

*****

### **DEALING WITH INTELLECTUAL TROLLING**

#### **Alexandra Bowen**, [@AlexandraABowen](https://twitter.com/AlexandraABowen)

Alexandra doesn’t want to let trolls define your experiences in work, in your
communities and in your projects. If you’ve ever had to deal with an
intellectual bully in an online community, on a project, or social media, you
know that it’s one of the most unpleasant aspects of the Internet.

An intellectual bully may be adding value, but is mostly condescending, rude and
aggressive. Toxic users shouldn’t have to define your online community.

So do you want a “death star” or “rock star” community member? Alexandra expands
on how to create inclusive experiences online.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** As a woman in tech, Alexandra has experienced some very
negative trolling and abuse, as many people have. Some examples and themes may
trigger.

### **BUILDING WORLD CLASS TEAMS FROM DEVELOPING NATIONS**

#### **Juan Pablo Buritica**, [@buritica](https://twitter.com/buritica)

When you think of Latin America & software, the first thought that comes to mind
is near shoring or off shoring. When building the engineering team for Ride,
Juan decided to see if they could build a world-class engineering team from
Latin America by giving opportunities to former consultants of near shoring
companies.

This talk goes over the decisions made, the lessons learned and the unexpected
impacts they saw when they offered talented near shoring consultants with low
pay and gave them a high trust environment to flourish and a membership in a
highly motivated team.

### **LUNCH TIME** 😋

It was great to see the sponsors involved from some great companies. The
official job fair sponsors were [Intel](https://medium.com/@intel), Automattic,
and [Meetup](https://medium.com/@meetup) — all marvelous companies.

### **CROSSING THE LANGUAGE DIVIDE: MAKING PROGRAMMING ACCESSIBLE TO ENGLISH AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS ALIKE**

#### **Aditya Mukerjee**, [@chimeracoder](https://twitter.com/chimeracoder)

In *The Hitchhikers’s Guide to the Galaxy*, the Babel Fish is a universal
translator. By allowing all beings to communicate regardless of language, it
“neatly crosses the language divide between any species”.

Most programming languages are designed for English speakers. Programming
language keywords are usually in English, and programmers must understand a
basic amount of English in order to collaborate with others on open-source
projects written in those languages.

But does this need to be the case? Could we create a truly multilingual
programming language — one that can be localized, so any developer only ever
reads or writes code using their native language, all while maintaining
interoperability with code written by developers who speak a different language?
And how would we create a multilingual programming language community, allowing
developers to collaborate on open-source projects even when they don’t speak the
same (human) language?

Aditya looks at an example of a localized programming language: করো (*koro*),
which localizes the Go programming language into Bengali and expands on how this
could be extended to other languages as well.

He also talks about the steps to making open-source projects fully multilingual
so that developers who only speak English can collaborate seamlessly with
developers who don’t speak English at all.

### **HOW TO BE BOSS WHEN YOU’RE NOT THE BOSS: EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES FOR EVERYONE!**

#### **Natali Wachtman Perilo**, [@NataliJewel](http://twitter.com/NataliJewel)

The most effective leaders are those who can rely on others to execute
confidently and independently. Leaders are measured by how others perform.

Natalie uses applied behavioral science strategies to understand why people do
things and how we can prevent common issues when communicating, negotiating,
motivating, and leading while working collaboratively on teams.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden/status/807646762907430912">ashe dryden on Twitter</a></h4><p>Listen to understand, not to respond. @NataliJewel #alterconf</p></blockquote>

### **IT’S NOT LIT: STRATEGIES FOR EXPOSING AND ELIMINATING CULTURAL APPROPRIATION IN MARKETING**

#### **Candace Williams**, [@teacherc](http://twitter.com/teacherc)

From tweets written by agency agency staffers, to tech talk slides and “witty”
café chalkboard signs, the use of appropriated artifacts and slurs has been
normalized in product and service marketing.

In this talk, Candace identifies examples of this issue and leads a
brainstorming session. The talk covers practical strategies marginalized folks
and accomplices can use to expose and eliminate these practices in their place
of work.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** Images of appropriative marketing materials may be shown
during this talk. Examples might relate to race, ethnicity, national origin,
gender identity, sexuality, and other aspects of identity.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden/status/807650623034454016">ashe dryden on Twitter</a></h4><p>Instead of referring to people as marginalized, consider using "under siege", as it's active and centering.@teacherc #alterconf</p></blockquote>

### **DISMANTLING THE BINARY, ONE MICROAGGRESSION AT A TIME**

#### **Jameson Hampton**, [@jameybash](http://twitter.com/jameybash)

Microaggressions. You know, the slights that sting but seem so small that you
feel like you’re overreacting, even though they become more and more hurtful the
more (dozens of) times you hear them?

This talk will make visible the microaggressions too regularly lobbed at
non-binary people in tech, discuss how to combat them, and what self-care we can
employ when on the receiving end.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** Transphobia.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd/status/807655285888159744">Sarah Judd on Twitter</a></h4><p>If I try to be on a website, and it only has 2 genders, I decide, well I don't have to be on this website" @jameybash #alterconf</p></blockquote>

*****

### **BATTLING UNCONSCIOUS BIAS**

#### **Neem Serra**, [@teamneem](http://twitter.com/teamneem)

Unconscious biases affect our perceptions, decisions, and interactions every
day. How do we address biases if we don’t know about them?

In this talk, Neem talks about how to recognize and counter the biases that play
a part in interviewing, creating a product, and day-to-day interactions. She
goes in depth on biases beyond sexism and racism and hopes to help the world
become a more magical place!

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden/status/807667777930661889/photo/1">ashe dryden on Twitter</a></h4><p>Bias can be unintentional, but have same effect as if it were.

### **HOW A PERSONAL CHATBOT CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER**

#### **Lauren Golembiewski**, [@laurengolem](http://twitter.com/laurengolem)

Chatbots are re-emerging as a technology that can be used to automate
businesses, give big brands more customer touch points, and help individuals
better communicate.

In her talk, Conversational Designer, Lauren will be diving into the exciting
opportunities personal chatbots bring individuals, and how she believes they
will ultimately make our lives better.

She’ll also be discussing Ghostbot for Burner, a chatbot she designed that aims
to make dating better for those that receive harassment while online dating.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** Lauren will be discussing online sexual harassment in
this talk, but she does not cite any specific examples. She will also be calling
out sources where users can seek out examples of harassment that are vulgar and
sometimes violent, but will only reference the source and give me warnings as to
what can be found there. She will also be discussing how harassment affects
women and other marginalized groups online and will cite some statistics around
that concept.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden/status/807671603354075136">ashe dryden on Twitter</a></h4><p>Chatbots for could be used for hard to navigate things: scholarships, working w/ insurance cos, applying for food stamps #alterconf</p></blockquote>

### **THE CULT(URE) OF STRENGTH**

#### **Emily Gorcenski**, [@EmilyGorcenski](https://twitter.com/EmilyGorcenski)

“Strength,” “Courage,” and “Bravery” are virtues often heaped upon individuals
undergoing hardship. These compliments come from a deep-rooted cultural value
that sacrifice should be praiseworthy and that performing in the face of
difficulty is a sign of virtue. In tech, strength is valued to the point of
caricature, creating a culture of depersonalization and overwork that
disproportionately affects people who exist on one or more axes of inter
sectional marginalization.

This talk explores the culture of strength through the lens of my 15 year
journey through the STEM pipeline, intersecting on ability, gender, mental
health, and race. Emily also provide tools for effectively recognizing,
handling, and talking about hardship in the workplace or community.

> *This talk made me shiver — it was so powerful!*

*The YouTube video was made private.*

### **“YOU MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT RACE” — AN APPEAL FOR EMPATHY IN DISCUSSIONS OF RACISM IN AMERICA**

**Kareem Francis**, [github.com/kareemf](http://github.com/kareemf)

This talk highlights select instances in media, pop-culture, and forums for
technologists where the depiction of people of color is generally glossed over
by the population at large, but may be problematic to people of color, though
discussion of these issues are often relegated to discussions in safe spaces.

This talk also seeks to encourage guests to identify and avoid pitfalls common
in cross-cultural discussions of race. This will include encouraging people of
color to recall that, when engaging members of other races on the topic of race,
we are often challenging their world view.

Kareem goes on to encourage non-colored guests that the most prevalent and
exhausting forms of racism are not outright bigotry, but microaggressions.

*❗ Trigger Warnings: Race, racism, microaggressions.*

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/lizthegrey/status/807692147419820032">Liz Fong-Jones on Twitter</a></h4><p>The history of word 'articulate' in the history of racism is terrifying. Meant conforming to white stereotypes for white comfort #alterconf</p></blockquote>

### **INCREDIBLE WITNESS: FINDINGS FROM THE PUBLIC LABORATORY**

#### **Allison Parrish**, [@aparrish](https://twitter.com/aparrish)<br> **Clarinda
Mac Low**, [@adniralc](https://twitter.com/adniralc)<br> **Lauren Bierly**,
[@l_bierly](https://twitter.com/l_bierly)

Incredible Witness is a public laboratory created by these three ladies that
asks: how can people ever be “credible witnesses” when even the most basic
perceptions, such as color vision or spatial awareness, differ drastically from
person to person?

We live in a historical period where many traditional binaries are breaking
down. Some of the most basic assumptions about social life and hierarchies are
fragmenting–ideas around gender, race, sexuality, and ability are being
questioned and re-framed.

Incredible Witness seeks to encourage this disintegration, and find ways of
learning to accept each other fully, beyond the categories.

In the Incredible Witness laboratory, they invite people into unusual perceptual
worlds to bring home viscerally how different each person’s experience of the
world can be, using games and game-based environments. The talk will review the
results of their participatory experiments and point to future activities.

### **DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN TECH THROUGH A HAMILTON LENS**

#### **Lizzie Siegle**, [@lizziepika](http://twitter.com/lizziepika)

Though both diversity and inclusion are important, it’s not enough to be in the
room where it happens, which is like diversity. You want both the Adams
Administration as well as Washington on your side, which is like inclusion. The
latter breeds the former because even on a diverse team, you could still be
uncomfortable and helpless.

After attending and speaking at tech Meetups and conferences on both American
coasts, Lizzie realized that companies should initially focus on inclusion,
which will in turn lead to diversity. Lizzie realized that the diversity
initiatives were successful because of the empowering and supportive atmosphere
and that that same atmosphere is also obtained through inclusion and not
necessarily diversity.

So what’s the difference between the two? Lizzie uses Hamilton lyrics to go over
similarities, differences, and the importance of both.

About a month ago, I was honored to have the opportunity to freelance
blog for AlterConf NYC.

The conference left me inspired and less alone, as technologists from
all walks of life surrounded me throughout the conference.

Indeed, AlterConf was hands down the **MOST** diverse conference I have
ever attended and I find this aspect to be more important than ever,
especially considering what the year 2016 has brought us.

To give you an idea of how amazing this conference was, here is a
thorough rundown of what was discussed with snippets taken from social
media.

OPENING ADDRESS

OPENING THE INTERNET: LOOKING BEYOND ENGLISH DOMINANCE
------------------------------------------------------

**Christina González**,
[`@c_gonzalez`](https://twitter.com/c_gonzalez?lang=en)

The global Internet audience has been steadily changing over time. The
structure of the Internet itself, however, has been slower to catch up.
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), which utilize non-Latin alphabets
and diacritic marks, were proposed in the mid-90’s, but not realized
until 2010. Even now, not all services play nicely with them. In a
country and a world where the Internet can serve as a lifeline to
learning tools, as well as opportunity, access must go beyond simply
connecting to the Internet.

While changes are coming, there is still widespread inconsistency in how
user-friendly to non-English speakers some of the country’s, and
sometimes the world’s, most popular sites and services are. There may be
top trending hash tags worldwide on Twitter in Arabic, but user names
must be in Latin characters. There’s a disconnect between the creators
of services and spaces and today’s current and potential audiences.

Christina addresses this from a personal perspective (Do you really need
that accent on your name?) to a wider one, points out some of these
inconsistencies, and talks about possible solutions.

DEALING WITH INTELLECTUAL TROLLING
----------------------------------

**Alexandra Bowen**,
[`@AlexandraABowen`](https://twitter.com/AlexandraABowen)

Alexandra doesn’t want to let trolls define your experiences in work, in
your communities and in your projects. If you’ve ever had to deal with
an intellectual bully in an online community, on a project, or social
media, you know that it’s one of the most unpleasant aspects of the
Internet.

An intellectual bully may be adding value, but is mostly condescending,
rude and aggressive. Toxic users shouldn’t have to define your online
community.

So do you want a “death star” or “rock star” community member? Alexandra
expands on how to create inclusive experiences online.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** As a woman in tech, Alexandra has experienced
some very negative trolling and abuse, as many people have. Some
examples and themes may trigger.

BUILDING WORLD CLASS TEAMS FROM DEVELOPING NATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

**Juan Pablo Buritica**, [`@buritica`](https://twitter.com/buritica)

When you think of Latin America & software, the first thought that comes
to mind is near shoring or off shoring. When building the engineering
team for Ride, Juan decided to see if they could build a world-class
engineering team from Latin America by giving opportunities to former
consultants of near shoring companies.

This talk goes over the decisions made, the lessons learned and the
unexpected impacts they saw when they offered talented near shoring
consultants with low pay and gave them a high trust environment to
flourish and a membership in a highly motivated team.

CROSSING THE LANGUAGE DIVIDE: MAKING PROGRAMMING ACCESSIBLE TO ENGLISH AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS ALIKE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Aditya Mukerjee**, [`@chimeracoder`](https://twitter.com/chimeracoder)

In *The Hitchhikers’s Guide to the Galaxy*, the Babel Fish is a
universal translator. By allowing all beings to communicate regardless
of language, it “neatly crosses the language divide between any
species”.

Most programming languages are designed for English speakers.
Programming language keywords are usually in English, and programmers
must understand a basic amount of English in order to collaborate with
others on open-source projects written in those languages.

But does this need to be the case? Could we create a truly multilingual
programming language - one that can be localized, so any developer only
ever reads or writes code using their native language, all while
maintaining interoperability with code written by developers who speak a
different language? And how would we create a multilingual programming
language community, allowing developers to collaborate on open-source
projects even when they don’t speak the same (human) language?

Aditya looks at an example of a localized programming language: করো
(*koro*), which localizes the Go programming language into Bengali and
expands on how this could be extended to other languages as well.

He also talks about the steps to making open-source projects fully
multilingual so that developers who only speak English can collaborate
seamlessly with developers who don’t speak English at all.

IT’S NOT LIT: STRATEGIES FOR EXPOSING AND ELIMINATING CULTURAL APPROPRIATION IN MARKETING {#it-s-not-lit:-strategies-for-exposing-and-eliminating-cultural-appropriation-in-marketing}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Candace Williams**, [`@teacherc`](http://twitter.com/teacherc)

From tweets written by agency agency staffers, to tech talk slides and
“witty” café chalkboard signs, the use of appropriated artifacts and
slurs has been normalized in product and service marketing.

In this talk, Candace identifies examples of this issue and leads a
brainstorming session. The talk covers practical strategies marginalized
folks and accomplices can use to expose and eliminate these practices in
their place of work.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** Images of appropriative marketing materials may
be shown during this talk. Examples might relate to race, ethnicity,
national origin, gender identity, sexuality, and other aspects of
identity.

**Jameson Hampton**, [`@jameybash`](http://twitter.com/jameybash)

Microaggressions. You know, the slights that sting but seem so small
that you feel like you’re overreacting, even though they become more and
more hurtful the more (dozens of) times you hear them?

This talk will make visible the microaggressions too regularly lobbed at
non-binary people in tech, discuss how to combat them, and what
self-care we can employ when on the receiving end.

HOW A PERSONAL CHATBOT CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER
------------------------------------------------

**Lauren Golembiewski**,
[`@laurengolem`](http://twitter.com/laurengolem)

Chatbots are re-emerging as a technology that can be used to automate
businesses, give big brands more customer touch points, and help
individuals better communicate.

In her talk, Conversational Designer, Lauren will be diving into the
exciting opportunities personal chatbots bring individuals, and how she
believes they will ultimately make our lives better.

She’ll also be discussing Ghostbot for Burner, a chatbot she designed
that aims to make dating better for those that receive harassment while
online dating.

❗ **Trigger Warnings:** Lauren will be discussing online sexual
harassment in this talk, but she does not cite any specific examples.
She will also be calling out sources where users can seek out examples
of harassment that are vulgar and sometimes violent, but will only
reference the source and give me warnings as to what can be found there.
She will also be discussing how harassment affects women and other
marginalized groups online and will cite some statistics around that
concept.

THE CULT(URE) OF STRENGTH {#the-cult-ure--of-strength}
-------------------------

**Emily Gorcenski**,
[`@EmilyGorcenski`](https://twitter.com/EmilyGorcenski)

“Strength,” “Courage,” and “Bravery” are virtues often heaped upon
individuals undergoing hardship. These compliments come from a
deep-rooted cultural value that sacrifice should be praiseworthy and
that performing in the face of difficulty is a sign of virtue. In tech,
strength is valued to the point of caricature, creating a culture of
depersonalization and overwork that disproportionately affects people
who exist on one or more axes of inter sectional marginalization.

This talk explores the culture of strength through the lens of my 15
year journey through the STEM pipeline, intersecting on ability, gender,
mental health, and race. Emily also provide tools for effectively
recognizing, handling, and talking about hardship in the workplace or
community.

“YOU MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT RACE” - AN APPEAL FOR EMPATHY IN DISCUSSIONS OF RACISM IN AMERICA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Kareem Francis**, [`github.com/kareemf`](github.com/kareemf)

This talk highlights select instances in media, pop-culture, and forums
for technologists where the depiction of people of color is generally
glossed over by the population at large, but may be problematic to
people of color, though discussion of these issues are often relegated
to discussions in safe spaces.

This talk also seeks to encourage guests to identify and avoid pitfalls
common in cross-cultural discussions of race. This will include
encouraging people of color to recall that, when engaging members of
other races on the topic of race, we are often challenging their world
view.

Kareem goes on to encourage non-colored guests that the most prevalent
and exhausting forms of racism are not outright bigotry, but
micro-aggressions.

*❗ Trigger Warnings: Race, racism, micro-aggressions.*

INCREDIBLE WITNESS: FINDINGS FROM THE PUBLIC LABORATORY {#incredible-witness:-findings-from-the-public-laboratory}

**Clarinda Mac Low**, [`@adniralc`](https://twitter.com/adniralc)

**Lauren Bierly**, [`@l_bierly`](https://twitter.com/l_bierly)

Incredible Witness is a public laboratory created by these three ladies
that asks: how can people ever be “credible witnesses” when even the
most basic perceptions, such as color vision or spatial awareness,
differ drastically from person to person?

We live in a historical period where many traditional binaries are
breaking down. Some of the most basic assumptions about social life and
hierarchies are fragmenting–ideas around gender, race, sexuality, and
ability are being questioned and re-framed.

Incredible Witness seeks to encourage this disintegration, and find ways
of learning to accept each other fully, beyond the categories.

In the Incredible Witness laboratory, they invite people into unusual
perceptual worlds to bring home viscerally how different each person’s
experience of the world can be, using games and game-based environments.
The talk will review the results of their participatory experiments and
point to future activities.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN TECH THROUGH A HAMILTON LENS
-------------------------------------------------------

**Lizzie Siegle**, [`@lizziepika`](http://twitter.com/lizziepika)

Though both diversity and inclusion are important, it’s not enough to be
in the room where it happens, which is like diversity. You want both the
Adams Administration as well as Washington on your side, which is like
inclusion. The latter breeds the former because even on a diverse team,
you could still be uncomfortable and helpless.

After attending and speaking at tech Meetups and conferences on both
American coasts, Lizzie realized that companies should initially focus
on inclusion, which will in turn lead to diversity. Lizzie realized that
the diversity initiatives were successful because of the empowering and
supportive atmosphere and that that same atmosphere is also obtained
through inclusion and not necessarily diversity.

So what’s the difference between the two? Lizzie uses Hamilton lyrics to
go over similarities, differences, and the importance of both.
