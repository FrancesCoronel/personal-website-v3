> Originally planned for release in April 10th, 2017 but stuff happens.

After interviewing with a few of the new and upcoming alternative long-term programs for CS education, I wanted to provide others a brief overview of how they operate differently.

Most coding bootcamps are 2 to 4 months (8 to 12 weeks) long.

These programs instead act as alternative options to a CS degree which is usually 4 years long.

You can find the syllabus for the 1st year of their program
[here](https://holbertonschool.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/syllabus/holberton_school_syllabus_03082017010101.pdf).

Holberton

less cp mv rm mkdir which is cat echo

* internet projects with deadlines - always released at midnight
* no formal lectures/teachers
* access to resources that have more experience and knowledge
* overlapping batches
* staff here on-site who write most of the projects anyways
* mentors who are available in a number of different channels (emails, slack,
  meetups (fireside chats), in-person)
* -> no formal teacher - just uses mentor to provide up to date knowledge on
  whatever they're working on
* i.e. mentor who is a man who works in cyber-security in SF (Dave) - look over
  my resume
* --> networking really important component of those who come in
* -- constant feedback on program and how it is relevant in industry
* we cannot implement things that we think are important - so whatever we're
  teaching here - they have to be relevant for industry
* mentors critique curriculum and provide feedback in different roles/companies
* huge sense of comraderie and teamwork and collaboration --> important for us
  to
* current student interviewing me
* help other students --> status quo
* focuses community, collaboration, and helping others, sharing knowledge

2 year program

1st 9 months --> 60 hours a week --> on-site intensive learning

first 3 months

* theories, fundamentals
* C programming languages
* projects build up
  * last one is "building a shell"

next 3 months

* front-end
* back-end
* APIs
* databases
* uses Python
* not about learning Python but about understanding methods/routes and
  understanding OOP fundamental concepts so you could easily translate that
  syntax
* C projects don't stop

next 3 months

* systems administration
* devops

next 6 months

* full-time internship
  * this can turn into job
* full-time job

next 9 months

* full-time specialization
* part-time
* if a bunch of people in your cohort are interested in something specific -
  then that is a specialization that is created - has to be at least 4 people in
  a specialization
* no set group of specializations because industry changes every year
* specializations now: low-level algorithms, back-end engineering, system
  administration/devops/SRE (site reliability engineer)
* specialization can be done part-time --> meant with full-time job
* others are back full-time with specialization b/c they didn't get full-time
  job after 6 months or they choose hiatus/quit
* majority choose part-time

Questions

* personal experience
* current cohort (started in January)
  * 50% female, 30 or 40%
  * 50% POC
* average age range
  * most of students are in mid-20s to 30s
  * right out of high school
  * at least 18
  * 40's, 50's, 58 is oldest we've gotten
* are any of projects given by a contract
  * all are created by staff here
  * staff members are not experts in front-end/UX/UI field
  * so some you can collaborate with mentors
* can you give me examples of jobs folks from your cohort have gotten
  * systems administration/devops roles
  * 2 people with Apple doing SRE
  * 2 people with Dropbox doing SRE
  * 1 with Docker as SWE
  * 1 with LinkedIn as SWE
  * 2 people with medical tech company as SWE intern
  * full-time jobs right after Holberton but it's definitely not the expectation
  * 3 with scality as junior SWE
* are you part of the program
  * 1st batch
  * 1 year and a half
  * worked at Holberton school-time
  * specialization project: evenings & weekends
    * 10 hours/week
    * back-end engineering
  * what are your future plans?

Hi Holberton!

I'm Frances. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at Cornell Tech and
consider myself both a budding developer/designer.

I've been in love with the tech field for about 5 years now (basically since my
junior year of high school) and despite usually being the only minority female
in the room a lot of the time, I can't think of ever wanting to leave.

I'm super passionate about publishing just about anything I make online - either
via GitHub Pages, Behance, Speaker Deck, Scribd, Devpost, YouTube, or just my
own personal portfolio.

In my spare time, I actively chase conferences, Meetups, hackathons, and try to
speak at events myself whenever I get the opportunity.

My end goal is to inspire the next generation of developers like myself and I
think Holberton is the next natural step in that process. Talk to you soon! :)

I would recommend using the game Lightbot to prepare. A bulk of their admissions
process to getting into a piscine involves solving puzzles exactly like ones you
would find playing Lightbot but a bit more complicated.

If you are interested in something other than Computer Science,
[MissionU](https://www.missionu.com/) offers a one year program in **Data
Analytics + Business Intelligence**. It has a tuition deferral model which means
you only pay once you get a salary of at least $50K.

## Common Patterns

* Gamification
* thorough admissions process
* All bootcamps will accept someone who is at least 18 years

# To Trust or Not To Trust

**Coding bootcamps** are growing
[_more and more popular each year_](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/09/17/as-coding-bootcamps-grow-the-skills-gap-could-shrink)
. 📈

Beginning in 2012, coding bootcamps began offering courses in software
development and promising graduates new careers in technology. The schools, now
backed by hundreds of millions in VC funding, will educate about **30,000
students** in 2016, and rake in just shy of **half a billion** in tuition fees.
💰

Even the creator of
*["Cracking the Coding Interview"](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
*has gone ahead and vouched for the
*[value of coding bootcamps herself](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-that-whole-coding-bootcamp-thing-is-a-scam-right-6fddf14087d4#.meynkdi7c).
*📖

**But a key pain point** for a lot of potential students is whether or not
they’ll really be able to get a job right afterward and how **trustworthy** it
is.

To combat this, in early 2015, a group of coding schools sent a letter to
President Obama,
[pledging to release standardized and audited outcome reports](https://thenesta.org/).
That never happened. 😞

As of today,
[_Flatiron is still one of the very few coding bootcamps_](https://blog.flatironschool.com/announcing-flatiron-schools-2015-jobs-report/)
in the world with an independently verified job placement report for all
graduates. 💼

This app would make that a reality for all coding bootcamps by automatically
parsing information from LinkedIn and Glassdoor in order to **predict job
placement salary** based off of **publicly available alumni and job salary
data**. 🎉

The app can also validate alumni reviews by **aggregating them** from across the
web where they are posted (Yelp, Quora, Course Report, techendo, etc.) and
filtering to include only **unique reviews**. 🎉🎉

Ultimately, the goal is to add a layer of trustworthiness to coding bootcamps
which as of right now, have
*[no standard measurements for job placement rates](https://www.ibtimes.com/code-boot-camps-fail-obama-unaudited-stats-cast-doubt-success-rates-2301188)
*with some going as far as
_[trying to hide negative reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h6abk/are_coding_bootcamp_horror_stories_common/)_.👺

The demand for this kind of product is very high and here are two recent
articles that speak more on this:
_[Could coding boot camps see stricter standards?](https://www.myajc.com/news/technology/could-coding-boot-camps-see-stricter-standards/ns4kQ/)
_(Nov 2016) and
_[Students are demanding the facts about coding bootcamps](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/25/students-are-demanding-the-facts-about-coding-bootcamps/)_
(Aug 2016). 📰
