1) Successfully promoting intersectionality means featuring women of diverse backgrounds and specifically holding or sponsoring events that cater to that audience. For example, TechIntersections 2019 is a conference for the women of color most underrepresented in tech to come together and learn from each other’s successes, challenges, and experiences. It is one of a few conferences that caters specifically to those who have intersectional experiences.

2) Intersectionality in tech means recognizing there are differences between being a minority and being a double, triple or quadruple minority. For example, I am both a woman and I am Latina. Ergo, I'm a double minority and my identity intersects with both how women and Latinas get treated within the tech industry. It has to be recognized that my experience can be vastly different than a white woman's because of those intersections.

A concrete example of this topic being explored is at the Latinx in Tech conference were there was a panel on "Intersectional Identity & Code Switching".

We know that there are many intersections to one's identity, and would love to get your perspective on how intersectionality impacts women in tech: 1) What does successfully promoting intersectionality in tech look like? 2) How do you recognize, promote, or celebrate intersectionality in tech? *
