## Tools

* This book is published using the platform [GitBook](https://gitbook.com "GitBook").
* A one-page website for the book is located at [hubook.strikingly.com](https://hubook.strikingly.com/ "Strikingly | HU Book").

## Why this project?

* This book would have been so helpful when I was starting out, so I wanted others who were in my place to at least have a smoother process when it comes to integrating to their new college environment.
