# Overview

I was put in charge of some of the online branding and website for `Yes Hair`, a group aiming to promote minority beauty through hair products.

> This project was completed in `November 2014` for the Yes Hair committee at Hampton University.

_Disclaimer: The project has since been discontinued._
