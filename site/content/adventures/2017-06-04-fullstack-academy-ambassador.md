## About

Fullstack Academy's flagship program is a full-time accelerated bootcamp for software engineering. Named "Best Coding Bootcamp" in the country by SkilledUp, a leading tech-education publication. Y Combinator backed.

In January 2016, Fullstack Academy launched Grace Hopper Academy, the first all-women coding bootcamp in New York City, and the first in the country to offer a deferred tuition model.

## Role

### Ambassador (Part-Time)

Around the winter of 2016, Fullstack was asking for interested alumni to be a part of the ambassador program.

The ambassador program involved referring students to the program and then mentoring the accepted students in exchange for a stipend.

Through this program, I created a lot of material that I felt would be of help to prospective Fullstack Academy students and was able to guide and mentor a student who got accepted to the new Grace Hopper program.

Although I am no longer formally an ambassador, if you're interested in learning more about Fullstack Academy and how to best prepare for entering the program, feel free to personally reach out to me.

I'd be delighted to walk you through the process and provide helpful resources.
