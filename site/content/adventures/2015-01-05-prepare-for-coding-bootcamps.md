description: 'Before my interviews with all the coding bootcamps I applied to, I did some digging and really went out of my way to try and find out what would make me a better candidate in the entire process.'

## **How are students selected?**

### There are 2 main ideas behind selection.

![](https://www.javatpoint.com/images/javascript/javascript_logo.png)

**1. You have a basic working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.**

- They judge you on how you think, not what you know
  - How willing are you to learn?
  - What is your potential to succeed?
  - Can you demonstrate the aptitude to pick up simple concepts?
  - Have you learned a reasonable amount of JavaScript on your own?
- Their ability to teach you is very important
  - You should not be afraid to ask questions (be honest about your weaknesses).
  - \^ No such thing as stupid questions.
  - Have a positive attitude under pressure.
- Synonyms that come up to describe the ideal student
  - `warm`, `smart`, `driven`, `compassionate`, `capable`, `friendly`, `dedicated`
- You don't have to be expert coder, but a good learner.

**2. You are a good fit for the program.**

- Culture fit is vital in the interview process
  - They want to make sure everyone gets along (so show your best self).
  - You're fun to hang out
  - You do not ring any alarm bells (ergo, not an asshole).
  - There are \~30 applicants for each student, but it is important to note that qualified applicants typically underestimate themselves and reputation
  - Your formal education and previous job success does not matter, only your ability to code

## **How do I prepare?**

_The Gist Of It_

> You will go through a pair programming interview process that (usually) pushes you beyond your comfort zone (in terms of programming, hehe).

**Helpful Resources**

- [coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/ 'Coderbyte Easy') - the easy challenges
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript 'Codecademy') - the JavaScript track
- [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript 'Code School') - the `Road to JavaScript`
- [Eloquent JavaScript: 2nd Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net 'Eloquent JavaScript') - basically reading the whole book would be helpful, but if you can't do that, then the 1st 5 chapters are pretty key

**Going All Out**

- [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742 'JavaScript: The Good Parts') - the first few chapters
- [Functional JavaScript](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do 'Functional JavaScript') - again, the first few chapters

**Topics that are generally NOT covered in the interview**

- jQuery
- regular expressions
- AJAX
- node.js
- HTML/CSS

**Topics that CAN be covered in the interview**

- plain old JavaScript
- callbacks (passing functions as arguments to other functions)
- how anonymous functions and functions are stored in variables as callback arguments
- iteration through collections
- variable declarations, function signatures, if loops, conditionals
- built in array and string functions
- underscore JS functions
- RECURSION (yes, seriously, inception)

#### **Really Getting Down to The Nitty Gritty**

- What arguments are provided to each function, and what are their types?
- What gets returned out of a function, if anything?
- How and when do you use anonymous functions?
- What does it mean to be a higher-order function, and how are they composed?

#### **Potential Problem**

- Create an array of numbers, save it to a variable
- Use a loop to iterate through each element of the array
- Write a separate "doubling" function that returns any number it is given multiplied by two
- Pass each number from the array to the "doubling" function in turn
- Save the original numbers and the doubled results as key-value pairs in an object

Recently, SwitchUp released their 2014 list of the [top coding bootcamps](https://fvcproductions.com/blog/2015/02/20/brief-thoughts-best-bootcamps-switchup/ "Brief Thoughts on SwitchUp's Review for 31 Best Bootcamps 2014 💭"). I'd check that out too.

For finding them, refer to this post [where I look over the best websites for that purpose](https://fvcproductions.com/blog/2014/12/27/a-short-operation-tips-tricks-4-coding-bootcamps/ 'A Short Operation: Tips & Tricks 4 Finding Coding Bootcamps 🔎') and also the post where I [elaborate on each](https://fvcproductions.com/blog/2014/11/10/magnifying-the-bootcamp-research-experience/ 'Magnifying the Bootcamp Research Experience 🔎').

I also have shared my **interview experience** with bootcamps such as
