## About

A community conference for all things `npm`.

This was an A-mazing conference. Probably one of the most diverse conferences I’ve attended in tech and that’s saying quite a bit.

Such a vibrant community and the catering was just absolutely killer. Lemonade and veggie sandwiches - yummy! `#blessed`

I learned a bit about:

* how to publish a module to npm **favorite**
* increasing accessibility using aXe core
* different package managers out there besides npm
* the nodebot community and how important the code of conduct is
* semantic versioning
* Greenkeeper.io
* registry design patterns

Just so this page looks good, I created two versions of a banner for the conference from the website so that it is completely SVG ready.

They look like this...
