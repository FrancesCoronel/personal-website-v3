## About

Volunteered at the [urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders](//schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/05/M286/default.htm) in Harlem, NY through the [Hour of Code program](//hourofcode.com) & [ELiTE Education](//www.elite-education.org/csweek2016)'s CS Week of 2016.

Helped out middle school students in their [CodeCombat](//codecombat.com) lessons and gave a presentation to middle school girls on why they should learn to code.

I even received some swag from ELiTE Education in exchange! 😊
