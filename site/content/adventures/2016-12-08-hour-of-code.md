## About

Volunteered at the [urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders](https://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/05/M286/default.htm) in Harlem, NY through the [Hour of Code program](https://hourofcode.com) & [ELiTE Education](https://www.elite-education.org/csweek2016)'s CS Week of 2016.

Helped out middle school students in their [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com) lessons and gave a presentation to middle school girls on why they should learn to code.

I even received some swag from ELiTE Education in exchange! 😊
