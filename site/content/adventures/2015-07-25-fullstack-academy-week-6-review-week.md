## Day One - Monday

- This is my last week as a junior. I guess I could go all cliche here and say that time flew by, but eh, to be honest, I've time traveled in a pretty normal way, which does surprise me.
- I didn't go to school today. I was super sick. :(

- Thankfully, since we covered angular directives and `ng-model` today, it wasn't that bad since I finished that **Shaping up with Angular.js** Code School course.

## Day Two - Tuesday

- More work on the flashcards application.

## Day Three - Wednesday

- Today, my partner Yves and I were the only team that showcased a flashcard design. So by default, we both won and lost the mini-competition for the best flashcard design. We each get a Fullstack t-shirt (I still haven't gotten this yet -\_\_-).
- Here's how the home page for our design ended up looking like, more or less: ![HomePage](https://i.imgur.com/8Lh7IJw.png)
- We used [FlatUI](https://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/), naturally.

## Day Four - Thursday

- Spelunking.
- Second day working on authentication.
- Learning team lunch today. I'm getting better at Avalon. 😈

## Day Five - Friday

- More auth stuff.
- Last day of being a junior!!!
- My contribution to Fullstack so far has been this [Google Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZUYwxJzXCNsvC7x_tiwVRCIGVljh5EFzanV1U9WJl18/edit?usp=sharing) showcasing a bunch of web dev stuff I feel is relevant. I should probably update it soon. ![Fullstack Web Dev Tips and Tricks](https://i.imgur.com/hDbtU5A.png)
- We go over what's going to be in senior phase.
  - Unfortunately, I think I will only be able to work with other college of code students on my final project, since we have 2 less weeks. I don't know how I feel about this since I wanted to work with Yves, who isn't in the summer of code program, since we have complementary skills (my strong suite is front-end, his is back-end). Darn.

## Review Week!

### A week where we get a break from Fullstack, take some review assessments, and get the opportunity to revitalize for the intense project phase ahead of us.

> Monday through Wednesday

- Normally, I publish my posts every Friday, but since review week is right after my last junior week, I figured I'd just publish the Friday or Saturday of review week instead.
- I went back home and relaxed for most of this week.
  - Thankfully, the first three assessments for this week weren't mandatory.

> Thursday

- I'm the only person from 1506 who went to Game Night today. I played this creepy and descriptive house game. It was terribly complicated, but it was macabre enough to be somewhat enjoyable. 😈

> Friday

- I got to 4 kyu on [Codewars](https://codewars.com/users/fvcproductions) today. FINALLLLLLYYYY.
- While working late, I come across this show called [**Dating Naked**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dating_Naked) and I'm just blown away. `#reviewweeksurprise`
- I'm pretty excited for the project phase. :)

> Saturday

- This Saturday, I'll be attending the [Sally Conference](https://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/223064683/). The tickets are **300 DOLLARS**, but Shanna G., who is part of the hiring team here at Fullstack, had some free tickets to give out - so to you, Shanna, I say...
