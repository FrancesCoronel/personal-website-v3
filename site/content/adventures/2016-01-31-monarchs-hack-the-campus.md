For an upcoming hackathon at [ODU](https://odu.edu) dubbed [`Monarchs Hack the Campus`](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~acm/hackathon/), I'm acting as a volunteer and am already helping out with some pretty big tasks.

### Tasks

* branding
  * created 4 new banners using Sketch and existing logo (credits to Michelle Graham for the logo)
* the actual website
  * **completely redesigned** from the bottom up to have a nice look and feel based on an HTML5UP template
* registration
  * redesigned and made some minor changes to the configuration for the Typeform used as registration for those interested in attending the hackathon
