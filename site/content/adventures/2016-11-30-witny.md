## About

Java Talk is a WiTNY program designed specifically for undergraduate CUNY women with an interest in computer science and technology. The beta CUNY School is Baruch College.

The goal of Java Talk is to create an opportunity for young women with an interest in a career in tech to have a brief, informative, informal conversation with a professional.

The Java Talk program will:

* Allow students to have one-on-one open interactions with professionals in the tech sector
* Help students learn more about a career path with a focus in technology and entrepreneurship
* Provide a vehicle for transferring technical as well as formal and informal industry-related and career-focused knowledge

Through this program, I was given the chance to mentor a CIS major at CUNY. I personally enjoyed the mentoring session a lot and look forward to participating in similar events in the future.
