Created a simple to-do app in Laravel 5.3 using Homestead.

This app was done for an engineering internship screening for [DoSomething.org](https://DoSomething.org).

The source code can be found at <https://github.com/fvcproductions/ds-todos>.

The full process for setting up Laravel 5.3 is pretty tedious so I created [my own tutorial](https://fvcproductions.com/2017/01/13/launch-todo-app-laravel/) as well!
