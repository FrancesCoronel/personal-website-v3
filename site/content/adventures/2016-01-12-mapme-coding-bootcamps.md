Check out the **crowd-sourced** map at\
[`mapme.com/coding-bootcamps`](https://mapme.com/coding-bootcamps) =================================================================

The world is teeming with coding bootcamps, but I just couldn’t find a more geographically/visually oriented website that showed all the physical coding bootcamps that are available out there.

In comes [**Coding Bootcamps**](https://mapme.com/coding-bootcamps "Coding Bootcamps"), _a crowd-sourced map_ that provides links to in-person coding bootcamps/development schools located worldwide using the service [MapMe](https://mapme.com/ "Mapme").

> I began working on this project in **November 2014** and provided a big update on **January 12, 2016**. It is still a WIP.

## Stats as of November 2016

* 300+ schools listed so far
