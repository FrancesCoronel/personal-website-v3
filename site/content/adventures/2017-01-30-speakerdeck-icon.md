So I am in LOVE with [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com). 😍

BUT I can't even find a good version of their bloody logo to use for my website or projects!

What gives, GitHub? Geez. 🙄

So I decided to just create my own using their crappy small logo I could find from their website as a baseline.

Now I can use the logo with whatever background I want! 😊

If you want access to the Sketch file, feel free to download it from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/fvcproductions/sketch). 😺
