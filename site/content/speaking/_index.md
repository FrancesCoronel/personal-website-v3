## I've given talks on a variety of topics.

If you'd like me to speak at an event, don't hesitate to [reach out](/about/contact)!

### Presentations

All my presentations can be found on my <a href="//slideshare.net/fvcproductions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SlideShare <i class="fab fa-slideshare"></i></a>.

I used <a href="//speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Speaker Deck</a> in the past but that account is no longer maintained as I believe SlideShare has more useful features.
