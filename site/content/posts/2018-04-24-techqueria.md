> Techqueria is one of the largest communities of Latinx professionals in the tech industry.

Spent a whole weekend revamping the existing website of Techqueria using a custom Hugo boilerplate I created called Hugoma.

Still in the process of being integrated into main website at https://techqueria.org - currently at https://beta.techqueria.org.

Helped spearhead creation of `#website` channel in Techqueria's Slack for more collaborative development of the new website.
