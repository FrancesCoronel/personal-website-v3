Foodie
My stomach is angry with me.

Regrets are a deep pain if they are so immediate.

If you ever read this again, recall the amount of pain and horrid regret you caused yourself by ordering a chocolate milkshake along with 2 large fries and 2 packets of Polynesian sauce. Never again can you do this.

For as long as you live.

No more milkshakes or cookies from Subway or Chick-fil-A, not respectively.

A Little GRE
I have an alacrity to design AI someday, but I fear my mindset is much too prosaic at times.

Therefore, I’ll speak out with with veracity that I have the paucity of an appropriate background.

I maintain then the fact that I feel terribly contrite.

I, being an laconic individual, have suffered from my pugnacious guardians who are as disparate as night and day.

Indeed, it seems I am as egregious as last night’s dinner, which was a bowl of thick vanilla ice cream... when all but 10 inches of snow lay resting outside.
