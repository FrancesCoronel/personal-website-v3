<em>I REGRET NOTHING</em>.<p>My official last day of Fullstack was <strong>Wednesday, August 26, 2015</strong>, but I’ve been so busy getting ready for school and settling in back home, it’s been hard to focus on writing anything substantial.<p>Anywho, the last week and 3 days of Fullstack was a bit of a whirlwind, with my uncle’s birthday and relatives coming over along with making sure the Capstone project looked presentable.<p>As I’ve mentioned before, I worked on the Capstone project with only one other person - Joanna. She was pretty great to work with, and I’m actually pretty happy with what we were able to manage in such a short span of time.<blockquote><p>“Together, our brains created Hiredot.”</blockquote><hr /><p><img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ballicons-2-free/100/wrench-128.png" alt="Hack" />{.aligncenter}<h2 id="hiredot">Hiredot</h2><p>Specifically, <strong><a href="https://github.com/joanaz/HireDot2">Hiredot</a></strong> is a portal where current students, potential students, alumni, employers, and even guests can explore the various aspects of the Fullstack Academy experience. Students and companies can also be matched together through their preferences using the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stable_marriage_problem" title="Stable Marriage">stable marriage algorithm</a>.<p>[gallery type=”slideshow” size=”full” link=”file” ids=”2705,2704,2701,2699,2698,2697,2702,2700,2703”]<hr /><p><img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ballicons-2-free/100/theatre-128.png" alt="Friends &amp; Family" />{.aligncenter}<h2 id="friendsfamilyday">Friends &amp; Family Day</h2><p>So my last day involved demoing our capstone projects to everybody’s friends and families. My brother, Tío, and Tía were able to attend.<p>[instagram url=https://instagram.com/p/63Rvp7wGZx/]<blockquote><p>A few of the Summer of Code students saying goodbye to my learning team fellow, Jimmy. If it isn’t obvious already, he went to UT Austin. :P</blockquote><p>Saying goodbye is unpleasant so I just didn’t for the most part with most people. The circumstances were also slightly tricky with everyone’s relatives being around and all.<p>My folks went back only slightly earlier before me and headed to China Town, so I went home alone on the dreadful subway, got some pizza, and watched what would probably be the last episode I ever watch of the show <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dating-naked/" title="Dating Naked">Dating Naked</a> (why is it so intriguing?!).<p>Probably not a very ideal way to end an awesome experience, but then again, it was also really relaxing. :mrgreen:<hr /><p><img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ballicons-2-free/100/luggage-128.png" alt="Traveling" />{.aligncenter}<h2 id="goingbackhome">Going Back Home</h2><p>My bus ride home with my brother was early the next morning.<p>I didn’t really get any rest with the noise so that was kind of dreary, but during the ride, my next interview was scheduled with Apple Retail for Friday so I was happy. Also, the fact that I was greeted by my dog, Nefer, and my mom’s sweet iced tea didn’t hurt either.<p>On Friday, I’d also be starting my course ‘Design 101’ on <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/" title="Designlab">Designlab</a>.<p>Friday comes and the course gets me all excited. I’m able to access the course a few hours before the interview. I’m even starting to write about my experience with the course in a separate post.<p>It’s Sunday now and the first class of my last undergrad semester starts tomorrow at 10 am.<p>Should be interesting.<hr /><h3 id="for-the-rest-of-this-post-i-want-to-cover-a-few-other-smaller-points-fortherestofthispostiwanttocoverafewothersmallerpoints">For the rest of this post, I want to cover a few other smaller points. {#fortherestofthispostiwanttocoverafewothersmallerpoints.}</h3><hr /><p><img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ballicons-2-free/100/bill-128.png" alt="Pricey Stuff" />{.aligncenter}<h2 id="thetotalcost">The Total Cost</h2><p>I use <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Mint</a> to track all my costs so it was pretty easy to figure out how much I spent on everything.
