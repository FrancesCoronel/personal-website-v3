Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose
business challenges to Cornell Tech. In Product Studio, teams develop
and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those
challenges.

My team is responding to **The New York Times (Community)** challenge.

The challenge is as follows:

> How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to
> discuss important local, national, and global issues?

## Narrative

Today older white men represent the majority of people who comment on
The New York Times articles.

The homogeneity of that user base is creating a barrier to discussion
from the larger population, which is stunting growth.

In order to stay relevant, The New York Times will need to engage
diverse users by stimulating more conversation.

## Features

Introducing "Most-Discussed" on the New York Times app. Here, you can
see articles ranked by the number of comments, with curated comments
from different perspectives. The user photos invite comments from more
diverse users by showing that this is an inclusive environment.

Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose
business challenges to Cornell Tech. In Product Studio, teams develop
and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those
challenges.

My team is responding to **The New York Times (Community)** challenge.

The challenge is as follows:

> How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to
> discuss important local, national, and global issues?

Narrative

Currently the majority of New York Times commenters are older white men.
But that group is just a small slice of the larger population, which
means that many readers—people who have valuable experiences and
expertise to share—are shut out of the conversation.

As a solution, we want to invite commenters from all backgrounds in, as
a way of expanding and enriching the New York Times’s user-generated
content. By celebrating different voices, we believe we can create value
for both the New York Times and its readers.

Journey

We arrived at our current product after a few wrong turns. After the
last sprint, we received some critical feedback and we realized that we
were too focused on creating value for the New York Times, not its
readers.

User Research-

So we conducted some user interviews with *Times* readers and we learned
that people are demotivated from commenting when they don’t think they
have anything informative to contribute; when they don’t think their
comments will be seen or valued; and when they don’t care about the
issue.

Working Demo

Meet Chumeng, an Asian-American woman (Chumeng is actually Chinese, but
for the sake of our user story, we’re saying she’s Asian-American).
She’s reading an article about how more Asian Americans are becoming
Democrats. Looking at the current layout of the comments section,
there’s no space carved out for her opinion. She doesn’t trust that her
opinion will be valued here, and she doesn’t immediately have an idea
about what information she could share.

With the new Q+A feature, the story is different. Now Chumeng’s opinion
is being solicited directly with a question related to her background.
She is being prompted to share something specific, so she thinks, Aha! I
have something to add here. And she can see the opinions of other
Asian-Americans on display, so she knows it’s an environment that will
support her opinion. And because the question is tagged "Asian
American," she can see how her background makes her especially qualified
to make a comment.

Validation Findings

To validate our product, we built wireframes for targeted A/B testing.
Of the people we tested, 90% said they were more likely to read the
comments with our interface, 80% said they were more likely to comment,
and 100% said they were more likely to do one or the other. We also saw
a lot of smiles and got a lot of unsolicited positive feedback. And from
our alumni crit, we got feedback that ranged from "There’s really
something here" to concerns about our feature inviting trolls in as
well.

Architecture Evolution

There are two major parts to our system. One is the editor’s view and
one is the reader’s view. The editors input the article into the New
York Times content management system, and through IBM Watson’s Alchemy
API, we can extract key concepts and entities from the article, and use
these to generate targeted questions. The editors then formulate the
appropriate questions, and these appear on the New York Times commenting
platform.

Narrative

Hi, we’re the New York Times (Community) Team, Delia, Chumeng, and
Frances.

Our challenge was How might we create a safe place for people of all
backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?

The people who comment on the New York Times platform are fairly
homogeneous: they tend to be older, they tend to be white, and they’re
more likely to be men. As a result, Times readers are missing out on
different perspectives, and the Times is missing out on an opportunity
to grow its commenter base and build a stronger relationship with its
audience.

So we thought, how can the comments section do a better job of inviting
people of all backgrounds in? Through our user research, we found that
people are more motivated to comment when they feel they have specific
knowledge to share because of their experiences—and people get more
value out of reading comments that are informative.

Coded Out Solution-

Let’s walk you through our coded out solution. Meet Ana. She doesn’t
subscribe to the Times, and she has never commented.

One day, a friend shares an article on Facebook. She clicks through to
read it, and she sees a pop-up. When she clicks the pop-up, she’s shown
a question that resonates with her. Based on Ana’s reading history on
the Times, our system has made a guess that she is Latina, and made the
default question and comment view one that pertains to her background.
She can click through to see the other questions, and she can switch
tabs to view comments from people of other backgrounds, including
children of immigrants and language experts.

She stays on the site longer than usual, reading through the responses
and looking at the data visualization about the comments. Thanks to the
question prompt, she can see that she has valuable information to
contribute. So she composes and posts her comment. This makes the
commenter base more diverse, and we can keep Ana coming back to read and
comment by sending her email digests about other relevant questions and
comments.

User Validation

For user validation, we performed A/B testing and found that 90% of our
test subjects were more likely to read the comments with our Q&A
platform, and 80% were more likely to actually post a comment
themselves.

Technology

But where do these questions come from? The Q&A platform uses the IBM
Alchemy API to automatically generate smart entities from the text of an
article. Each of these entities then acts as a potential group of
readers who can provide valuable insights for the article. The reporter
can then compose questions targeting each of these reader groups.

Reporter Validation

And when we talked to a Times reporter, we got feedback that our
platform could not only integrate well into her work-flow but also into
the content management system that she uses to publish articles.

Impact-

But the real value of Q&A, aside from the fact it diversifies the
commenter base, comes from how we are creating a platform that takes the
highest quality journalism and adds on the most informative
user-generated content.

Monetization

Since a commenter self-identifies as belonging to one or more groups, we
are able to subtly collect reader background information which leads to
smarter targeting.

Product Development

In terms of product development, we focused more on fleshing out the
front-end since we feel that’s where our product value lies and with the
back end, we got as far as being able to extract smart entities from
article text.

Business Objective-

Our business objective is to convert occasional readers, like Ana, into
engaged digital subscribers. We estimate that we can convert 30,000
non-subscribing readers into digital subscribers by keeping them coming
back to the site directly, pushing them over their monthly limit of ten
free articles.

Go To Market Strategy-

We recommend taking the feature to market via pop-ups on the site, a
feature explaining Q&A, social media, and email notifications.

Our Journey

We floated a lot of ideas before settling on Q&A, and we pivoted after
doing user research with Times readers. So we definitely learned to know
our users first. Also, we saw that active engagement is really important
to the future of news, and traditional media outlets like the Times
recognize this and are adapting.

What’s Next

Lastly, to hand off our product, we plan to provide all of our assets to
the NYT team. Thank you.
