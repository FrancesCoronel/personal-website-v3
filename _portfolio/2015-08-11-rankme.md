Overview
========

I developed a web app (still in **BETA**) that ranks coding bootcamps
based on social and rating score based on data crawled from various
sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp, Course Report, Facebook, AngelList,
Google+, etc.) using
[Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio "Cheerio") and [the MEAN
stack](https://mean.io "MEAN stack").

> This project was completed on `August 11th, 2015` for the Stackathon
> phase of [Fullstack
> Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy").
