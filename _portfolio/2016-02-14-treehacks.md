*Ammalia*, which means surgery in Arabic, is a Leap Motion assisted app
that allows a surgeon to analyze pictures of their patient's problem
(i.e. brain tumors) using the Dropbox API.

 

-   *Use cases?*
    -   The areas we believe Ammalia could be the most useful is with
        radiology image manipulation / scrolling while scrubbed in &
        sterile in the OR.

### Branding

-   Theme Color: `#62A7C6`
-   Font: `Karla`

### Future features

1.  We can see Ammalia potentially pivoting to include 3D manipulation
    of MRI and CT scans mid-procedure, which is important when, for
    example, determining the extent of a tumor in real-time.
2.  Another area we could look into is radiology and cardiology
    intervention which would actually involve catheter manipulation.
3.  Also, depending on the patient chosen, Ammalia could also showcase
    different health record data points that pertain to the patient
    being showcased\
    (i.e. name, age, background, etc).

### Tools

-   [Leap Motion](https://developer.leapmotion.com/)
    -   uses Leap Motion API and hardware to track hand gestures (pan
        in/out, zoom in/out, slide right/left) without physically
        touching computer
-   [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers)
    -   use Dropbox for uploading/storing images for patient’s problems
    -   have folders within Dropbox API represent a single patient
