<h2 id="day-one-monday">Day One - Monday</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is my last week as a junior. I guess I could go all cliche here and say that time flew by, but eh, to be honest, I&rsquo;ve time traveled in a pretty normal way, which does surprise me.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t go to school today. I was super sick. :(</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/accredible_courses/images/11072/original/shaping-up-with-angular-js-ec0c2defe370994018c29f0b65e56a3b.jpg" alt="Shaping up with
Angular" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Thankfully, since we covered angular directives and <code>ng-model</code> today, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad since I finished that <strong>Shaping up with Angular.js</strong> Code School course.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-two-tuesday">Day Two - Tuesday</h2>

<ul>
<li>More work on the flashcards application.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-three-wednesday">Day Three - Wednesday</h2>

<ul>
<li>Today, my partner Yves and I were the only team that showcased a flashcard design. So by default, we both won and lost the mini-competition for the best flashcard design. We each get a Fullstack t-shirt (I still haven&rsquo;t gotten this yet -__-).</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s how the home page for our design ended up looking like, more or less: <img src="//i.imgur.com/8Lh7IJw.png" alt="HomePage" /></li>
<li>We used <a href="//designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/">FlatUI</a>, naturally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-four-thursday">Day Four - Thursday</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spelunking.</li>
<li>Second day working on authentication.</li>
<li>Learning team lunch today. I&rsquo;m getting better at Avalon. 😈</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-five-friday">Day Five - Friday</h2>

<ul>
<li>More auth stuff.</li>
<li>Last day of being a junior!!!</li>
<li>My contribution to Fullstack so far has been this <a href="//docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZUYwxJzXCNsvC7x_tiwVRCIGVljh5EFzanV1U9WJl18/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slide deck</a> showcasing a bunch of web dev stuff I feel is relevant. I should probably update it soon. <img src="//i.imgur.com/hDbtU5A.png" alt="Fullstack Web Dev Tips and
Tricks" /></li>
<li>We go over what&rsquo;s going to be in senior phase.

<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, I think I will only be able to work with other college of code students on my final project, since we have 2 less weeks. I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this since I wanted to work with Yves, who isn&rsquo;t in the summer of code program, since we have complementary skills (my strong suite is front-end, his is back-end). Darn.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="review-week">Review Week!</h2>

<h3 id="a-week-where-we-get-a-break-from-fullstack-take-some-review-assessments-and-get-the-opportunity-to-revitalize-for-the-intense-project-phase-ahead-of-us">A week where we get a break from Fullstack, take some review assessments, and get the opportunity to revitalize for the intense project phase ahead of us.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Monday through Wednesday</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Normally, I publish my posts every Friday, but since review week is right after my last junior week, I figured I&rsquo;d just publish the Friday or Saturday of review week instead.</li>
<li>I went back home and relaxed for most of this week.

<ul>
<li>Thankfully, the first three assessments for this week weren&rsquo;t mandatory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Thursday</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m the only person from 1506 who went to Game Night today. I played this creepy and descriptive house game. It was terribly complicated, but it was macabre enough to be somewhat enjoyable. 😈</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Friday</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I got to 4 kyu on <a href="//codewars.com/users/fvcproductions">Codewars</a> today. FINALLLLLLYYYY.</li>
<li>While working late, I come across this show called <a href="//www.wikiwand.com/en/Dating_Naked"><strong>Dating Naked</strong></a> and I&rsquo;m just blown away. <code>#reviewweeksurprise</code></li>
<li>I&rsquo;m pretty excited for the project phase. :)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Saturday</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>This Saturday, I&rsquo;ll be attending the <a href="//www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/223064683/">Sally Conference</a>. The tickets are <strong>300 DOLLARS</strong>, but Shanna G., who is part of the hiring team here at Fullstack, had some free tickets to give out - so to you, Shanna, I say…</li>
